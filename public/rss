Dylan Steck <a href="https://twitter.com/Dylan_Steck">@Dylan_Steck </a> is the creator of <a href="https://t.co/hOwfaKQ8oV?amp=1">Cortex</a>, an organization whose mission is creating what he calls valuable <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/tools-for-action-6475cf3343f1">Tools for Action</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-tools-for-action">What are "Tools for Action"?</h3><p>Tools for Action are implementations designed with the goal of helping people organize their thoughts, and ultimately their actions, in the same way a "Tool for Thought" does. Recently, we wrote about <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/zettelkasten-method-and-digital-notetaking/">Zettelkasten</a>, the Tool for Thought conceived by a prolific German academic that's been embraced by Roam Research enthusiasts (often dubbed the #RoamCult).</p><p>Dylan wants to take these existing Tools for Thought and build upon them to create new and effective action-oriented tools. A key part of Cortex’s mission is to prioritize the repurposing of existing tools. From the Cortex website:</p><blockquote><em>Cortex is a value-based technology organization. We want to reassemble tools to democratize knowledge and creation. All of the work that we do is led by a guiding thesis:<strong> we can re-purpose pre-existing tools to solve the easiest problems without starting from scratch.</strong></em></blockquote><p>Between his interest in supporting portable and secure user data across the internet as well as empowering users to create without being encumbered by the burden of starting-from-scratch, Dylan is a natural friend of the Fission community. </p><h2 id="watch-the-video">Watch the video</h2><p>Check out the video below where we hear from Dylan and get to see and hear what he’s working on first hand.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Thinking of starting a Ghost blog but leaning towards "nah, too much work"?</p><p>Here's how you do it with <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Fission's Ghost Blog Starter</a>: click a button, choose a URL, watch a couple of spinners do their thing, and <em>voilà</em>: a production-ready Ghost blog instance is live on Heroku in less than 5 minutes.</p><p>Best of all? Image and video uploads—which aren't supported by default on Heroku due to its read-only filesystem—are built-in and work seamlessly. The <a href="https://elements.heroku.com/addons/interplanetary-fission">Fission Heroku Add-on</a> takes care of everything without intervention, creating a new Fission account for your blog, handling media uploads, and serving those assets for you on HTTPS and on the peer-to-peer IPFS network.</p><h3 id="going-headless">Going Headless</h3><p>Ghost is a great platform for authors, with almost a decade of accumulated improvements in user experience.</p><p>One shortcoming though is that it doesn't scale beyond a single server:</p><blockquote>Ghost doesn’t support load-balanced clustering or multi-server setups of any description, there should only be <em><strong>one</strong></em> Ghost instance per site.<br>— <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/faq/clustering-sharding-multi-server/">Ghost documentation</a></br></blockquote><p>Caching pages and serving them via a <em>content delivery network</em> (CDN) is one way to mitigate this. But if content has to be turned into static files and served from the edge anyway, why not go a step further and decouple Ghost, the authoring interface, from the code that generates those files based on the content?</p><p>That's the <strong>Headless CMS</strong> approach, where a <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generator</a> pulls the content from the content management system and builds the pages that can be served super-fast at scale at the edge. This opens up the possibility to tap into a rich ecosystem of frontend development tools and components (like React and others) for a much richer content experience, along with security and performance benefits.</p><p>On a previous post, we described how we're moving our own blog to a <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/headless-ghost-blog-fission/">Headless Ghost + Next.js</a> setup. This allows us not only to make the best out of what the frontend can do, but also to showcase how Fission enables personalization at the edge, something that used to be possible only with dynamically-rendered server-hosted websites.</p><p>By using our <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/heroku-ipfs-ghost">Ghost blog starter</a>, you can try this setup for yourself and follow along as we continue to share tools, process, and lessons on our own path to a webnative publishing experience.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Zettelkasten Method & Digital Note-taking]]></title><description><![CDATA[What does a prolific 20th-century German scholar have to do with digital note-taking?

Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system known as "Zettlekasten," and how you can use <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/">Fission and TiddlyWiki </a>to create your own version. </p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>This is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and published more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-1.01.30-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Zettelkasten Method & Digital Note-taking"><figcaption>This is Niklas Luhmann</figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Niklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive badass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking method he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words, Zettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means slip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is about creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.</p><h2 id="how-zettelkasten-works">How Zettelkasten works</h2><p>To use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:</p><ul><li>A way to take notes</li><li>A system with bidirectional linking</li><li>A collection of tags</li></ul><p>That’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.</p><h3 id="a-note-taking-system">A note-taking system</h3><p>Luhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a typewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very quickly--he used the hunt and peck method.</p><p>In fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of furniture--sort of like a card catalog.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-1.40.56-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Zettelkasten Method & Digital Note-taking"><figcaption>Not Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea</figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p/><p>While Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of paper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital note-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep offer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices. TiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power, which is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.</p><h3 id="a-system-with-bidirectional-linking">A system with bidirectional linking</h3><p>So what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability to connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One popular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam Research; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free, open-source program.</p><h3 id="a-collection-of-tags">A collection of tags</h3><p>The last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for your thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts or online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps, open-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing your ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a note-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you can easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.</p><h2 id="using-tiddlywiki-for-zettelkasten">Using TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten</h2><p>The great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to use the Zettelkasten system.</p><ol><li>A note-taking method.</li><li>Bidirectional linking</li><li>A system of Tags</li></ol><p>TiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries called “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2021/03/1.png" class="kg-image" alt="The Zettelkasten Method & Digital Note-taking"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><br/></p><p>Tiddlers are simple to tag.

And now that TiddlyWiki is building a version of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web native option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the benefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and bidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your Zettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and protected.</p><p>We are working on this project out in the open.

Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost? For small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair to say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with social media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what is the hidden cost to you? </p><p>If you have seen <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/"><strong>The Social Dilemma</strong></a> then you might be familiar with this quote:<br>“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel Hövermann</br></p><p>The hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from collecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your clicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases is your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.</p><p>Here’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported products, ads are presented to you.  These advertisements are curated based on cookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit within the app itself.  </p><p>Let’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a “post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an impression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming into your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment for your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar given what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant in our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7 out of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first glance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and monitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those who work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.</p><p>Using ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are collecting information about you. This information is collected via your behaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to infer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to where you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available simply from behaviours you exhibit online. </p><p>At Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very reason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal rates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. </p><p><strong>What happens when you pay for your app:</strong></p><ol><li>Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical and humane technological future.</li><li>Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.</li><li>Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal information for targeted advertisements.</li><li>Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers outside of North America and Western Europe.<br><em>a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of 		    500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a 		    $25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an 				        independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in developing 	    countries</em></br></li><li>Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers, “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something, the more they value it.”</li><li>Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.</li></ol><p>Let’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on the street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high school, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online every day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and games. Sounds insane right? </p><p>The future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to proliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of many is to pay for the applications and software you use. </p><p>At Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and privacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our mission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to be part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving developers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to easily charge for them.</p><p>For end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging into <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission’s Drive app</a>.

We also invite the community to come and give app demos. This week we invited Jeremy Rustin of the TiddlyWiki project to talk about his product and our plans to integrate Fission’s Webnative SDK with TiddlyWiki. </p><h2 id="meet-the-team">Meet the Team</h2><p>Our distributed team continues to grow with team members spanning from our HQ in Vancouver across three continents. Our newest addition is Courtney in 🇺🇸 North Carolina, United States. </p><p>Courtney (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/courtney">@Courtney</a>) joins us as our Marketing Lead. This was her first week with Fission and her first demo day. Look for more blog posts and email updates from Courtney about what's going on with Fission. </p><h2 id="fission-and-headless-ghost">Fission and Headless Ghost</h2><p>Fission teammate Helder (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/agentofuser">@agentofuser</a>) shared his work with Headless Ghost and Fission. He showed us how to use the Ghost CMS as a familiar editing interface for content producers and then pulling the content into a Next.JS website via API. Then, the content is compiled into a static website using React and deployed to the Fission platform. Check out the video to hear the details of this process. </p><h2 id="filecoin-backup-app">Filecoin Backup App</h2><p>Next, we heard from Ben (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/benjaminbollen">@benjaminbollen</a>) and Brian (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins">@bgins</a>) about their work with Filecoin. Filecoin is a blockchain specifically used for storing files online without relying on a third-party platform or company. Because Fission is also interested in working in browsers very securely, we decided to work with the Filecoin team on this project. Hear from Ben and Brian about their progress in the Fission Demo Day video. </p><h2 id="ipfs-cluster-updates">IPFS Cluster Updates</h2><p>Daniel (<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/u/dholms">@dholms</a>) talked to us about his updates to the IPFS Cluster. Fission is built on an Interplanetary File System (or IPFS) which is a global peer-to-peer network. Fission builds encryption on top of the IPFS stack, running IPFS servers to make sure that your data stays online and accessible directly from the browser, all with your security in mind. Daniel shares with us some recent backend infrastructure work he's doing to improve our system performance. </p><h2 id="tiddlywiki-and-fission">Tiddlywiki and Fission</h2><p>Jeremy Rustin (<a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">@jermolene</a>) is the creator of Tiddlywiki, a serverless web app that allows users to create a non-linear notebook for recording, organizing and sharing complex information. We're collaborating to build an app that will allow users to use TiddlyWiki on the Fission platform. You can hear from Jeremy directly in the Demo Day video. We’ve also been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> so hop over there to see what's going on. </p><h2 id="video">Video</h2><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/515125741?app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" title="Fission February 2021 Demo Day"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><h2 id="join-us-next-time"><strong>Join us next time</strong></h2><p>We're experimenting with <a href="https://lu.ma/">Luma</a> for registering for events.

When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into their data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:</p><ol><li>We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers, called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)</li><li>Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and can’t see your content.</li><li>We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.</li></ol><blockquote><strong>Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.</strong></blockquote><p>At Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built into modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a private encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.</p><p>By the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> and create a new Fission account. Notice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it doesn’t ask you for a password.</p><p>To use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or phone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to another device that already has permission.</p><p>Now, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have permission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all without setting up or having to remember a password.</p><p>Apple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps everyone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking the same approach.</p><h2 id="what-about-lost-devices"><strong>What about lost devices?</strong></h2><p>But what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the encrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now, the answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API built into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for security reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover your encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.</p><p>One of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of default use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do rely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards based on the real world support available in all major browsers, including mobile browsers.</p><h2 id="using-a-single-device-as-a-base-case"><strong>Using a single-device as a base case</strong></h2><p>Let’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile computing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that one mobile device means you’ve lost everything.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2021/02/markus-winkler-ZM0mca86fQM-unsplash-square-crop.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Inside Fission’s Account Recovery Design"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>This is the common base case we need to keep in mind.</p><p>It’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is much easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop device. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around for a really long time.</p><p>In fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">private key they used to securely connect to GitHub</a> was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of owning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!</p><p>But since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to plan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system accessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.</p><h2 id="splitting-up-keys"><strong>Splitting up keys</strong></h2><p>Our basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces. We then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user account.</p><p>The other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.</p><p>When the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it creates the complete key that can access the person’s account.</p><p>Because of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.</p><blockquote><strong>If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret keys to leak.</strong></blockquote><h2 id="where-should-i-store-recovery-codes"><strong>Where should I store recovery codes?</strong></h2><p>On Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating system — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included. We’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their Safari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.</p><p>On Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google services built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to using iCloud in our iOS example.</p><p>Advanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in Apple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password account, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2021/02/signal_note_to_self.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Inside Fission’s Account Recovery Design"><figcaption>Signal's <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self">Note to Self feature</a></figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And in the future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious users to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage backup keys.</p><h2 id="get-involved"><strong>Get involved</strong></h2><p>You can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432">Account Recovery design process</a> in the forum.</p><p>We’re not done with our design.

The first one is with the Ghost Content Management System (CMS). We use Ghost to run this blog and want to start using it to integrate with and power our home page, so it's a great place for us to start.</p><p>The basic pattern of "Headless" is that your authors and editors login to a server based system with all the authoring and editing tools they are used to, but then the "head" – the usual template system and user facing website – isn't used. Instead, a modern front end framework is custom designed and built to take the published content of the CMS and host it. This fits great with the Fission app publishing platform.</p><p>After we've got the basics of a headless publishing workflow setup with Fission, we'll move on to using our Webnative framework to add personalization at the edge, but that will come in later posts.</p><p>Aside from Ghost, we're also looking at <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-wordpress/1448">Headless WordPress</a> and <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-drupal/1513">Headless Drupal</a>. Let us know in the forum if you've got other Headless projects that you'd like to combine with Fission!</p><h2 id="build-a-next-js-blog-powered-by-headless-ghost-and-fission">Build a Next.js Blog powered by Headless Ghost and Fission</h2><p>Follow the tutorial below to get started with your own Headless Ghost, or <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">visit it on Github for the README version</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You want to have a modern static website/app built with React, deployed to a CDN (even a <a href="https://ipfs.io/">distributed</a> one), and loading super fast for visitors and search engines.</p>
<p>You want to avoid the headaches and costs of managing and securing servers for traditional content management systems (CMSs) like Ghost and WordPress.</p>
<p>That's what static site generators (like Next.js, Gatsby, and <a href="https://staticgen.com/">others</a>) are for, right?</p>
<p><em>But,</em> you <em>don't</em> want to have to <strong>retrain</strong> every writer and content creator on your team to use <em>Markdown</em> and <em>Git</em>. Ghost and WordPress are familiar, pretty, and usable. They have been iterated over years to be approachable by almost anyone.</p>
<p>What do you do? That's right you cut the CMS' head off 🔪</p>
<p>More politely, you <em>decouple</em> the interface used for <em>authoring</em> content from the systems used for <em>rendering</em> and <em>distributing</em> it.</p>
<p>With CMS and website decoupled, you can protect the CMS inside an intranet without exposing it to outside danger, or even use it as a desktop word processor running only on your machine, as I'll show you in this tutorial.</p>
<p>To make things easier we've made a template Next.js website that connects to Ghost and pulls content from it. Follow along and try it out. Feedback welcome :)</p>

<p>This starter template is based on the official <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript">blog-starter-typescript</a> from <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>.</p>
<p>We changed it only enough to make it possible to fetch and publish blog posts from the Ghost CMS, while keeping the ability to write Markdown files in the git repo. It's a purely additive change.</p>
<p>There's also a GitHub Action to build and publish the static website to Fission. It works automatically on pushes to the git repo, and can be triggered manually after updating the content on Ghost. (The default Ghost webhook isn't customizable to trigger a GitHub Action, but that can be added as a plugin.)</p>
<p>The Markdown blog posts are stored in <code>/_posts</code> as files with frontmatter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.</p>
<p>The Ghost blog posts are fetched using Ghost's Content API library.</p>
<h2 id="gettingstarted">✨  Getting Started</h2>
<p>Let's start by making this starter yours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Use this template</strong> at the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">starter page on GitHub</a></p>
<p>That will make a copy of the starter into a new repo under your account with a fresh git history. You can pick a different name for it too; in that case replace <code>nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost</code> with your chosen name below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone the repo (replace with your own URL):</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost.git
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>cd into the repo:</p>
<pre><code>cd nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install dependencies</p>
<pre><code>yarn
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All command-line instructions and directory paths from now on assume the current directory is the root of the cloned repo.</p>
<h3 id="settingupghost">👻  Setting Up Ghost</h3>
<h4 id="publicorlocalghost">Public or Local Ghost?</h4>
<p>Running a local Ghost instance is good for testing. But also, if you have no need for a Ghost instance running all the time out on the internet (for example, if you are the only author) you can do this for your production website, using Ghost locally for its nice interface if you prefer that to editing Markdown files. No servers to secure, no bills to pay.</p>
<h4 id="settinguplocalghost">Setting Up Local Ghost</h4>
<p>If you have a Ghost instance running already somewhere, move on to the next step. If you don't, you can set one up on your own machine with Docker.</p>
<p>To create a local Ghost instance with Docker, run the following at the root of your repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn ghost-local-create
</code></pre>
<p>Ghost data will be stored at <code>./ghost</code>, which is in <code>.gitignore</code> by default. In a <strong>private</strong> repo you can choose to commit that too and have your Ghost content versioned and available whenever you need it.</p>
<p>There are other scripts like <code>ghost-local-start</code>, <code>ghost-local-stop</code>, and <code>ghost-local-remove</code> which you might find handy to manage the Docker container.</p>
<p>After Docker downloads and sets up Ghost, it will be accessible on your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a>.</p>
<p>Next you need to create an admin account on your newly-created Ghost. To do that, visit the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> and follow the wizard.</p>
<h4 id="exposingtheghostcontentapi">Exposing the Ghost Content API</h4>
<p>I'll use <code>http://localhost:3001</code> for the examples, but you can replace that with your Ghost URL if you have an instance already running somewhere else.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a></li>
<li>On the left-hand sidebar, click on &quot;Integrations&quot;</li>
<li>On the Integrations screen, click on <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost/#/settings/integrations/new/">+Add custom integration</a></li>
<li>Give it a name, like <code>nextjs</code>, and click &quot;Create&quot; then &quot;Save&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the important part:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the same screen, you'll find two fields we need: <strong>Content API Key</strong> and <strong>API URL</strong></li>
<li>Copy those into a new <code>.env.local</code> file, like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># .env.local
# replace values with your own
GHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
GHOST_API_KEY=2a9356e4a5214c883ba886e58e
</code></pre>
<p>⚠️ <em>This file is ignored by git by default. <strong>Don't</strong> commit <code>env.local</code> to git unless you know what you're doing.</em></p>
<p>Alright! Ghost part's done.</p>
<h3 id="runningnextjslocally">💻  Running Next.js Locally</h3>
<p>Next.js is the missing static website <em>head</em> to our <em>head</em>less Ghost. Let's stitch them together! This should be enough:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn dev
</code></pre>
<p>Your blog should be up and running at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>! <em>(If anything unexpected happens, please post an <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost/issues/new">issue</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Now you can change the Next.js website code and the content on Ghost, and iterate quickly on them in the browser.</p>
<p><em>Note: live-reload works for Next.js code and Markdown files; to see changes to Ghost content you need to refresh the page.</em></p>
<h3 id="deployingtofission">🌐  Deploying to Fission</h3>
<p>When you're ready to publish, the first step is exporting your website to a set of static files:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">yarn build
</code></pre>
<p>That should create a directory at <code>./out</code> with all your ready-to-publish files.</p>
<p>Next we use the Fission CLI to send that out onto the internets.</p>
<h4 id="fissioncliinstallandsignup">🔰  Fission CLI Install and Sign Up</h4>
<p>To install the Fission command-line interface using brew, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">brew tap fission-suite/fission
brew install fission-cli
</code></pre>
<p>For more ways of installing the Fission CLI, please check the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Fission account, you can create one without leaving the command-line by running:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fission setup
</code></pre>
<h4 id="registernewfissionapp">🌱  Register New Fission App</h4>
<p>You can pick a subdomain or let Fission choose a random one for you.</p>
<p>To host the Next.js website at a random subdomain on <code>.fission.app</code>, run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fission app register
</code></pre>
<p>To choose your own subdomain, use the <code>--name</code> option like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fission app register --name my-beautiful-subdomain
</code></pre>
<p>That will create a <code>fission.yaml</code> file. <strong>This one is safe to commit to git</strong>, and you <em>should</em> do that if you want to use the GitHub Action to build and deploy the website for you. Make sure there is a line saying <code>build: ./out</code> in it. That's the directory where Next.js puts the exported website files.</p>
<h4 id="aandlaunch">🚀   Aand... Launch!</h4>
<p>One last step:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">fission app publish
</code></pre>
<p>And you're done! Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by the Fission CLI or at <code>my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app</code> if you used the <code>--name</code> option. Yay!</p>
<h4 id="semiautomaticdeploymentwiththegithubaction">🤖  (Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action</h4>
<p>If you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you make a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter comes with <strong>a GitHub Action that automates that for you</strong>.</p>
<p>To get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to the <strong>&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Secrets&quot;</strong> screen on your GitHub repo, then create a <strong>&quot;New repository secret&quot;</strong> for each of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GHOST_API_URL</code></li>
<li><code>GHOST_API_KEY</code></li>
<li><code>FISSION_KEY</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The values for the <code>GHOST_API_</code> fields are the same ones you used for the <code>.env.local</code> file above.</p>
<p>The <code>FISSION_KEY</code> was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when you set it up. Here's how you get it:</p>
<pre><code>cat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64
</code></pre>
<p>With all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the <code>deploy</code> action manually by clicking on <strong>&quot;Run workflow&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot;</strong>, or see it in action after your next <code>git push</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>⚠️  To fetch the content from Ghost, <strong>the GitHub Action must be able to access the URL</strong> entered in the <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> secret.</p>
<p>If you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, <code>http://localhost:3001</code> won't be visible to the outside.</p>
<p>A simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL is by using one of the <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling">open source alternatives to ngrok</a> or <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> itself.</p>
<p>With ngrok you do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>ngrok http 3001
</code></pre>
<p>⚠️  This is great for testing, but <strong>not secure</strong>. Look into using <code>https</code> if you're going to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Why <strong>&quot;(semi-)</strong>&quot; automatic then? 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo because <strong>there's a built-in &quot;on push&quot; event</strong> that can be used to <strong>trigger</strong> it.</p>
<p>But when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs a way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no <code>git push</code> event happening, so the trigger is usually a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event"><strong>webhook</strong></a> (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)</p>
<p>🙂  Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content changes happen.</p>
<p>🙃  <strong><em>Un</em>luckily</strong>, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in the webhook requests it sends, and GitHub <strong>requires</strong> a certain field to be present telling it which <code>ref</code> (usually a branch) you are referring to.</p>
<p>Bottom line: <strong>after changing things <em>on Ghost</em>, you need to trigger a build manually</strong>.</p>
<p>You can do that via the GitHub interface (&quot;Actions&quot; &gt; &quot;Continuous Deployment&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot;), or by <strong>running the handy script</strong> we added to this starter:</p>
<pre><code>GITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh
</code></pre>
<p>Here's how you can get an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">auth token</a>.</p>
<p>This situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins, but we wanted to stick to the basic install.</p>

This started as server applications, built with things like Django and Ruby on Rails and before them a variety of technologies that will live forever in corporations, like Java Servlets.<br><br>Backbone.js demonstrated that a lot of these applications could be moved into the browser, and then React and its many SPA-style competitors established a new order for the web – highly-interactive, quite complex, client-side applications.</br></br></blockquote><p>We don't necessarily agree with a lot of the changes that MacWright wishes for, but we do think that the <strong>documentic-centric web</strong> and the <strong>app-centric web</strong> is a useful way to think about the difference between websites that we access through our browsers.</p><p>Like an operating system, your desktop or mobile browser now provides common services for the many web sites – and increasingly web <em>apps</em> – that you access every day.</p><h2 id="web-native-apps">Web Native Apps</h2><p>At Fission, we're both building on top of features that the browser provides, and adding additional features that can be used by Fission-powered apps. </p><p>We call these apps "web native" apps:</p><ul><li>Works in all browsers, including mobile</li><li>Doesn't need browser plug-ins</li><li>Makes use of advanced web APIs in the browser, including on mobile</li><li>Has user owned data and storage</li><li>Gives users control over app permissions</li><li>Can function local-first, and in many cases, offline</li></ul><p>Web native apps are designed to run on the web, taking advantage of all the capabilities your browser has to offer, as well as native, local capabilities like identity, storage, and computation.</p><p>We're also very inspired by <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">Ink &amp; Switch's research findings on local-first software</a>, and continue to build on and implement the concepts they outline.</p><h2 id="asking-permission">Asking Permission</h2><p>One of the things that smartphone apps do is ask permission: can I use your camera? Can I access your files? Can I see your photos? For security reasons, these same sort of permissions are making their way into modern desktop operating systems as well.</p><p>With a regular web app, we don't get any of that. Or, even worse, we're clicking through an agreement for trackers and cookies to be used!</p><p>As a user, signing up for a hosted web app means agreeing to some terms of service. You're using an app that is running on someone else's server, where your data is stored. At best, you've got an export function, and hopefully a lowest common denominator format that you can import somewhere else. </p><p>Want to work with a batch of your images? First step, upload them all to a server. And hope that you can get export them later. Or that the developer has backed up those files in case something goes wrong. And, that the developer hasn't made any mistakes around security and privacy.</p><p>On our smartphones, we feel more in control. Apps ask us for permission. We can attach three or four different apps to our photo library, and switch between them, all the while having all of our photos available to us.</p><p>That's how we've built Fission's web native apps. Each app asks for permission, gets its own space to write files to. Everything is encrypted, and neither Fission nor the app developer can see your files without permission.</p><p>I'll quote MacWright again:</p><blockquote>There was a time when we could install applications, give some sort of explicit agreement that something would run on our computers and use our hardware. </blockquote><p>Using a web native app is more like installing an app. It uses your local identity, your files, and in many cases can even run offline.</p><p>It is using your browser as an operating system.</p><h2 id="web-native-apps-with-fission">Web Native Apps with Fission</h2><p>Fission is building an app hosting marketplace for developers and users that supports web native apps.</p><p>For developers, they can design a user app using only front end and design skills. The web native app can be installed by 10 or 10,000 users, just like mobile or desktop software. Because the app is running on the user's computer, you can focus on finding new users and adding new features, rather than having to learn DevOps or server scaling. It's the fastest way to start sharing – and soon, selling – your app on the web.</p><p>Users create a secure identity in their browsers. Every Fission account is linked to a file system, available in any browser. Much like an open source iCloud, users give permissions to apps, and can access their files from anywhere. Users can browse their file system, both public and private, and mix and match which apps they use, just like they're used to with mobile and desktop apps.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Our code is <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite">open source</a>.

It lets you write apps for the browser without having to write or deploy a back end. We're making use of fairly recent browser features and W3C standards to make this all possible. Read on for a technical summary, or <a href="https://talk.fission.codes">join us in the developer forum</a> to get into more detail.</p><p>One of the most common tasks for apps is authorizing users to perform some action, like storing new data to storage, updating records, or fetching a file. </p><p>Traditional app architecture has many users share one database ("multi-tenant"), with all user data fully interleaved with each other. Authorization here is primarily focused on keeping users from editing each other's records on this shared infrastructure. The server's rules give fairly coarse-grained control. Due to the inevitable exceptions to these rules, the logic becomes increasingly complex over time.</p><p>Even in a microservice architecture, typically all requests are funneled through a central authorization service. Over time this causes several challenges, including complex logic, cost of maintenance, tricky edge cases, and difficulty managing traffic spikes. In short: it doesn't scale well.</p><p>Even incumbents like<a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub41892/"> Google are moving away from the traditional auth server model</a> to overcome the above challenges. Fission has different constraints from Google and Amazon, but can adapt a lot of these ideas for our purposes. Essentially they're moving from a central auth server setup to a distributed model where more power is delegated to services.</p><p>What if we learn from Google's approach (plus older approaches like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2693">SDSI/SPKI</a>) but took it to its logic conclusion?</p><h2 id="introducing-ucans">Introducing UCANs</h2><blockquote>User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are a way of doing authorization where users are fully in control. OAuth is designed for a centralized world, UCAN is the distributed user controlled version.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/05/UCAN_SAM-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="UCAN: Authorizing Users Without a Back End"><figcaption>UCAN Sam</figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>At a high level, User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are a way of doing authorization ("what <em>you can</em> do") where users are fully in control. There's no all-powerful authorization server, or server of any kind required. Everything that a users is allowed to do is captured directly in a key or token, and can be sent to anyone that knows how to interpret this format.</p><p>Since all Fission accounts are equipped with a global ID and cryptographic keys, we were able to design a system that has very few assumptions and thus works in a huge number of situations.</p><p>This setup has several advantages:</p><ol><li>Low effort: developers don't need to write and maintain complex access logic</li><li>Familiar: uses very common JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)</li><li>Invisible: users don't need to know that anything special is happening</li><li>Flexible: access can be granted as coarse or granular as the end users wants</li><li>Scalable: no auth server bottleneck / scales infinitely</li><li>Secure: military-grade encryption</li><li>Collaborative: users and services and delegate a subset of their access to others</li><li>Self-contained: the token contains all the information needed to verify it</li></ol><p>UCANs are all that we need to sign into multiple machines, delegate access for service providers to do things while we're offline, securely collaborate on documents with a team, and more. We get the flexibility of fine- or coarse-grained control, all controlled by the one who cares about the data the most: the user.</p><p>We've implemented this as the authorization system for Fission, and are also making this available as a building block for developers to solve user authorization and delegation within their own applications.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>This system of authorization is broken into two halves: read and write (or "command and query", depending on your background). Without getting too in the weeds, here's a high level description of how this all works:</p><h2 id="read-query-access">Read (Query) Access</h2><p>Read access comes in three flavours: public, private, and unlisted. Access follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model?oldformat=true">object-capability model</a>, where anyone with the reference (URL or CID) and cryptograhic key can read the data by virtue of having access to these.</p><h3 id="public-">Public 👀</h3><p>Public files are just that: files that can be discovered or accessed by anyone at an easy-to read path.</p><p>Here's a live example: <a href="https://boris.fission.name/Photos/boris-with-icecream.jpg">https://boris.fission.name/Photos/boris-with-icecream.jpg</a></p><h3 id="private-">Private 🔐</h3><p>The user encrypts the data, and shares the key with those that should have access. The contents of a private directory is only readable with a key, but once you have access to that directory, all of the data in that directory (including subdirectories and metadata) is accessible.</p><p>The end experience matches the behaviour in other online consumer file storage solutions like Dropbox and Google Drive. A major difference with Fission is that the end user is given complete control over who has access, and access does not depend on Fission's servers being accessible (i.e. you're offline or Fission disappears).</p><h3 id="unlisted-">Unlisted 🗺️</h3><p>Sort of a mashup of public and private files! This is useful when you want to (e.g.) embed an image in an email without distributing keys, but also don't want it easily discoverable.</p><p>The unlisted files themselves are left unencrypted, but finding them is practically infeasible without the private index. Think of this index as a secret treasure map for the web — the map itself private (only a select few have the map), but anyone with it can find the data at the marked locations.</p><p>Under the hood, the Fission SDK creates a JSON file that lists all of the locations. That JSON file is then encrypted and the key passed to whoever should have access., or the links can be shared directly.</p><p>Here's a simple example of what this looks like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code class="language-javascript">// The "treasure map"

For example: sending an email, or updating DNS.</p><p>In a traditional OAuth based system, the "account" lives entirely on the server, and the user is granted access with a token<em><em>. </em></em>In Fission's design, the account is a key pair, and a UCAN is equivalent to an OAuth token. OAuth is designed for a centralized client/server world. UCANs are the distributed user controlled equivalent.</p><p>UCANs are simply <a href="jwt.io">JWT</a>s that contain special keys. Much of this will look familiar if you've done web auth in the past decade or so. Here's an example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-json">{

What I've described above was a fun exercise for me, but it's very &lt;insert-<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/yak-shaving-programming-term/582">yak-shaving</a>-gif&gt;.</p><p>The Fission tech stack gives users and developers a web native file system. Having files available everywhere, read/write, encrypted, and accessible through just a browser, means that developers can build apps that keep users in control of their files, and that a lot of existing apps can easily be connected to Fission. Serverless, as it were.</p><p>I wrote up what a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/fission-saver-for-tiddlywiki/616">"Fission Saver" would look like for TiddlyWiki</a> on our App Ideas forum, which is a very basic start. Since you can publish files with Fission, the TiddlyWiki would be hosted on Fission, but also write back to itself over the HTTP API. This is pretty much the same as the Git savers today.</p><p>But we can do better than that, since we have portable user IDs and a passwordless login which can do encryption. A "native" Fission adapter for TiddlyWiki would mean offline and online access to your data available everywhere, and encrypted or public data as needed. </p><p>I'm looking forward to more "serverless" thinking with the tools we now have, which TiddlyWiki had figured out 15+ years ago.</p></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Experimenting with HLS Video Streaming and IPFS]]></title><description><![CDATA[Walk through of encoding video using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and publishing to Fission.]]></description><link>https://fission-home-gatsby-dev.fission.app/experimenting-with-hls-video-streaming-and-ipfs/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5ea068b333f762001e6c6fae</guid><category><![CDATA[How To]]></category><category><![CDATA[IPFS]]></category><category><![CDATA[HLS]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Boris Mann]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:09:39 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501141178950-e7fa06e4adf5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501141178950-e7fa06e4adf5?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Experimenting with HLS Video Streaming and IPFS"/><p>We've been running <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/events/dweblunchnlearn/27">weekly developer lunch &amp; learn sessions</a> over video. I've been downloading the video from Zoom, doing some basic trimming, and then uploading it using Fission, and embedding the IPFS link in our Discourse forum. This works pretty well – Discourse recognizes the video file extension and embeds a video player in the post automatically. I had read a bit about HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and wanted to experiment.</p><p>Originally developed by Apple, and now widely supported, HLS doesn't need any special server-side support. A bit more in this freeCodeCamp article:</p><blockquote>The most important feature of HLS is its ability to adapt the bitrate of the video to the actual speed of the connection. This optimizes the quality of the experience.<br><br>HLS videos are encoded in different renditions at different resolutions and bitrates. This is usually referred to as the bitrate ladder. When a connection gets slower, the protocol automatically adjusts the requested bitrate to the bandwidth available.<br><br>– <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-hls-and-when-to-use-it/">freeCodeCamp: HLS Video Streaming: What it is, and When to Use it</a></br></br></br></br></blockquote><p>There's an <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/tree/master/examples/browser-video-streaming">example in the JavaScript implementation of IPFS about using HLS with js-ipfs</a>. The README explains:</p><blockquote>The fact that HLS content is just "a bunch of files" makes it a good choice for IPFS (another protocol that works this way is MPEG-DASH, which could certainly be a good choice as well). Furthermore, the <a href="https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js">hls.js</a> library enables straightforward integration with the HTML5 video element.</blockquote><p>"Just a bunch of files" is pretty much how we're thinking about Fission. Fission and any standard IPFS gateway serves up files over HTTP and/or natively with IPFS, without plugins, in any browser. It's really great to get back to what is basically the 2020 equivalent of upload files to the server.</p><p>I took the latest video file of <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/ceramic-network-technical-discussion-with-joel-thorstensson-cto-of-3box/559">Joel talking about Ceramic Network</a> and ran the <code>ffmpeg</code> command from the js-ipfs example.

Once an original video is encoded and added to the network by one person, it never needs to be encoded again. From some brief research, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/11088922">ffmpeg is not deterministic, which lead to this thread on Mastodon</a>. This means that different people encoding a video could get different output files, which means different hashes in IPFS.</p><p>However, the original video file is unique, so adding metadata to the original source video file for discovery of the unique, permanent hash of an HLS-encoded version could work.</p><p>We're currently doing some work on how to do this for images, so that different sizes are automatically available and cached in the network.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Fission is an app &amp; web hosting platform that implements a web native file system powered by IPFS.

The public key is shared widely, while the private key must be kept <br>completely secret. <br><br>There are two main use cases for public key cryptography: asymmetric encryption and digital signatures.<br><br><strong>Asymmetric encryption</strong> is a method by which Alice can send a message to Bob without leaking any information about her private key to Bob and nothing about the key or the message to the outside world. <br><br><strong>Digital signatures</strong> are a means of verifying that a message came from the holder of a certain private key and that the information has not been tampered with in flight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p><h3 id="how-on-earth-does-that-work">How on earth does that work?<br/></h3><p>All public key cryptography relies on the existence of <strong>one-way functions</strong>: mathematical functions that are very easy to calculate in one direction but nearly impossible to "undo", or calculate in the other direction.<br><br>RSA has been the predominant cryptosystem since its introduction in 1977. It relies on <strong>prime factorization</strong> of very large numbers.<br><br>Prime factorization is the process of breaking a number down into the product of prime numbers. This is easy with small numbers: for instance, the prime factors of 70 are 2 * 5 * 7. Now do that with a 2048-bit integer, and it ends up being pretty complicated.</br></br></br></br></p><h3 id="sweet-good-thing-someone-figured-that-out-now-we-can-all-kick-back-and-relax-knowing-all-of-our-information-is-secure-">Sweet good thing someone figured that out. Now we can all kick back and relax knowing all of our information is secure!<br/></h3><p>Well, computers are a lot faster nowadays than in 1977. Unfortunately that means that they're also getting faster at factoring large prime numbers. While a 256 bit key might've cut it at one point, now that key can be broken in ⌚👀, 103 seconds. <br><br>Computers and prime numbers are now in an arms race, with the current key size recommendation being 2048 bits. As keys get larger, operations obviously become slower. Meanwhile, the threat of quantum computing looms on the horizon. The now infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a> threatens to solve prime factorization in polynomial time. Which would render RSA as good as done.</br></br></p><h3 id="is-there-no-hope-for-privacy-">Is there no hope for privacy?!<br/></h3><p>There's a new one-way function on the block: <strong>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</strong>. Now with 100% less prime factorization! </p><h3 id="what-s-an-elliptic-curve">What's an elliptic curve?<br/></h3><p>Elliptic curves are cool looking curves that look like this: </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/01/ecc.png" class="kg-image" alt="Everything you wanted to know about Elliptic Curve Cryptography"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And are graphed with equations that looks like this: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><code>y^2 = x^3 + ax + b</code></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Except decimals are a bit unruly so we only take the integers, and then take a modulus of the function (basically wrap the graph around the edges like an old game of snake), so the graph actually ends up looking something like this (note there's still a horizontal line of symmetry):</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/01/sageplot_06.png" class="kg-image" alt="Everything you wanted to know about Elliptic Curve Cryptography"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h3 id="alright-but-what-do-these-have-to-do-with-cryptography">Alright, but what do these have to do with cryptography?</h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The basic procedure of ECC is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a curve and a point <code>P</code> on the curve (everyone uses the same point)</li>
<li>Choose an arbitrary very large number <code>N</code> (this is your private key).</li>
<li>Using point addition, add <code>P</code> to itself <code>N</code> times</li>
<li>The x-coordinate of <code>N*P</code> is your public-key</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="can-you-ground-this-in-reality-a-bit">Can you ground this in reality a bit?<br/></h3><p>Sure! Let's draw an analogy to adjusting a clock. Here are the same steps listed out but with a clock instead of an elliptic curve:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Grab a clock sitting at exactly midnight and choose an arbitrary number of seconds <code>P</code></li>
<li>Choose a very large number <code>N</code></li>
<li>Move the clock forward <code>P</code> seconds <code>N</code> times (pretend you have really fast hands 😜)</li>
<li>Give the clock to a friend and tell them how big each step was (<code>P</code>) then see if they can figure out how many times you moved it (<code>N</code>) to arrive at the current location</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="and-how-well-does-this-whole-thing-work">And how well does this whole thing work?<br/></h3><p>It turns out this is a much more robust one-way function than prime factorization. In fact, we can achieve the same security as a 3072-bit RSA key with a 256-bit ECC key. Not bad!</p><h3 id="what-if-someone-guesses-the-same-number-n-that-i-chose">What if someone guesses the same number <em>N</em> that I chose?<br/></h3><p>There's a mind-blowingly large range of numbers to choose from. Each key is 256 bits so you have <code>2^256 = 10^77</code> options. To give you a scale of how big this is, there are: </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><code>~10^18</code> grains of sand on earth</li>
<li><code>~10^22</code> stars in the observable universe</li>
<li><code>~10^78</code> atoms in the observable universe</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>So guessing someone's private key would be approximately equivalent to guessing a random atom in the <em>universe.</em></p><h3 id="doesn-t-it-take-a-long-time-to-calculate-my-public-key">Doesn't it take a long time to calculate my public key?<br/></h3><p>Nope, point addition is associative. Meaning:<br><code>P + P + P + P = (P + P) + (P + P) = 2P + 2P</code><br><br>So when calculating a <code>N*P</code> for a very large <code>N</code>, you only need to calculate <code>P + 2P + 4P + 8P...</code>  <br><br>At most, you must calculate 256 terms. Trivial for a computer. But to guess the public key for a given private key, you would need to check every number in between (that big number we talked about earlier).</br></br></br></br></br></p><h3 id="how-do-these-keys-translate-into-cryptographic-functions">How do these keys translate into cryptographic functions?<br/></h3><p><strong>ECDH</strong> is a key sharing algorithm, most commonly used to send encrypted messages. ECDH works by multiplying your private key by another's public key to get a shared secret, then using that shared secret to perform symmetric encryption.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>To illustrate why this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice and Bob agree on a curve with starting point <code>P</code></li>
<li>Alice has a private key <code>a</code> and public key <code>A = a * P</code></li>
<li>Bob has a private key <code>b</code> and public key <code>B = b * P</code></li>
<li><code>a * B = a * b * P = b * A</code></li>
<li>So <code>a * b * P</code> ends up being the shared secret</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>ECDSA </strong>is a signature algorithm, used to prove authenticity of some information. The algorithm is a bit trickier than ECDH. <br><em>Warning: lots of equations, feel free to skip to the takeways below.</em></br></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>Alice and bob agree on a curve with starting point <code>P</code></li>
<li>Alice has a private key <code>a</code> and public key <code>A = a * P</code></li>
<li>Alice chooses a random <code>k</code> and point <code>K = k * P</code></li>
<li>Alice takes <code>r</code> which is just the x-value of <code>K</code></li>
<li>Alice hashes her message to produce hash <code>H</code></li>
<li>Alice calculates a value <code>s = inv(k)*(H+ra)</code></li>
<li>Alice sends her message to Bob along with the signature <code>(r, s)</code></li>
<li>Bob calculates <code>H</code> from the message</li>
<li>Bob ensures that <code>r = H*inv(s)*P + r*inv(s)*A</code></li>
<li>If it does, the signature is valid!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you skipped those equations or they don't quite click, the key <strong>takeaways</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice sends a random value <code>r</code> and a calculated value <code>s</code> that could only be calculated with a combination of the private key, the message hash, and the random value, but gives away no information about her private key.</li>
<li>Bob can verify <code>r</code> and <code>s</code> by using just the message hash and Alice's public key</li>
<li>You <em>need</em> a good source of randomness to use ECDSA. If you're randomness function is broken, repeated signatures can disclose your private key</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="real-quick-you-mentioned-symmetric-encryption-how-does-that-work">Real quick, you mentioned symmetric encryption. How does that work?</h3><p>Symmetric encryption uses just one key to encrypt and decrypt a message. Encrypted messages just look like random jumbles of letters and numbers that give no information about the underlying message unless you have the key to "unjumble" it. Most algorithms use a <strong>block cipher. </strong>This involves choosing a block size (say 64 bits), and encrypting the message in blocks of that size.</p><p>We mentioned symmetric encryption when talking about ECDH. When people say "asymmetrically encrypted", they actually mean "symmetrically encrypted with a secret that is shared asymmetrically".</p><p>A few examples of algorithms are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20">Salsa20</a>, or <a href="https://keybase.io/triplesec">Triplesec</a> (which is actually just a combo of the first two for <em>extra security</em>).</p><h3 id="okay-i-generally-understand-how-this-works-but-how-do-people-decide-on-a-curve-and-a-point-p">Okay, I generally understand how this works, but how do people decide on a curve and a point P?<br/></h3><p>A bunch of different ways, sometimes they're chosen for a specific reason, sometimes they're algorithmically determined. Different curves have different properties. Checkout <a href="https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/">Safe Curves</a> for an analysis of different curves.</p><h3 id="can-faulty-curves-give-backdoors">Can "faulty" curves give backdoors?<br/></h3><p>Yes! Faulty curves can give shortcuts to determining a private key from a given public key. <br><br><em>Many suspect that NIST curves have NSA backdoors in them.</em> <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/201402/rnoti-p190.pdf">This is because a published NIST randomization algorithm (that the NSA tightly collaborated on) was found to have a backdoor.</a> We encourage you not to use any curves published by the NIST!</br></br></p><h3 id="what-s-this-edwards-curve-i-keep-hearing-about">What's this "Edwards Curve" I keep hearing about?<br/></h3><p>Most Elliptic curves are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve"><strong>Montgomery Curves</strong></a>. Edwards Curves were described by mathematician Harold Edwards and popularized by cryptographer Daniel Bernstein. They have a different structure that allows for a faster signature algorithm. This signature algorithm, when performed on an Edwards curve, is called <strong>EdDSA</strong>. This algorithm runs in constant time, meaning it's faster and leaks less information</p><h3 id="can-edwards-curves-do-key-sharing">Can Edwards Curves do key sharing?<br/></h3><p>Edwards curves are specifically used for signatures. There is not a related Diffie-Hellman key sharing algorithm.</p><h3 id="so-if-i-want-to-use-both-ecdh-eddsa-i-need-two-key-pairs">So if I want to use both ECDH &amp; EdDSA, I need two key pairs?<br/></h3><p>Not exactly. Let's take the most common Edwards curve <strong>Ed25519</strong>. This curve is related to Montgomery curve <strong>Curve25519</strong>. In fact Ed25519 is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twists_of_curves">twist</a></strong> of Curve25519. A "twist" basically means that the curves are mappable to one another. What this means is that you can use the same private key to generate a public key on both curves and then transform those public keys between one another without any knowledge of the private key. Specifically, with these equations.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>(u, v) = ((1+y)/(1-y), sqrt(-486664)*u/x)
(x, y) = (sqrt(-486664)*u/v, (u-1)/(u+1))
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>(u, v)</code> is the Curve25519 point and <code>(x, y)</code> is the Ed25519 point</p>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h3 id="this-is-sweet-why-doesn-t-everyone-have-a-private-key">This is sweet! Why doesn't everyone have a private key??<br/></h3><p>We ask ourselves the same question everyday. The main reason is: it's a pain. Keys look scary (<code>6A576D5A7134743777217A25432A462D4A614...</code>). And if you lose a key, you're forever screwed. There's no "recovery by email" available. </p><h3 id="what-are-people-doing-about-this">What are people doing about this?<br/></h3><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We need to fix the UX of public keys. Remove the scary hexadecimal strings and provide more painless recovery.</p>
<p>A few options are</p>
<ul>
<li>Replication: Share the same key across multiple devices. If you drop your phone in a lake, you can recover your key with your laptop</li>
<li>Shamir Secret Sharing: This involves splitting a key up into separate &quot;shares&quot;. Each share reveals nothing about the key, but by combining the shares back together, you can recover the private key. This leads to interesting solutions like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/pay-your-friends-to-protect-your-keys-one-startups-new-take-on-crypto-custody">social recovery</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/@amanladia1/zerowallet-a-zkp-based-wallet-authentication-mechanism-9871dcca0a01">zero-knowledge key recovery</a> which we implemented as a <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/zerowallet-poc">Proof of Concept</a>.</li>
<li>Secure Hardware Enclaves: Many phones and computers that are coming out these days have Secure Hardware Enclaves. These use both hardware and software to provide <em>very</em> strong security gurantees</li>
<li>Hardware Secure Modules (HSMs): These are similar to Secure Hardware Enclaves, but larger and hold more information. Physical modules exist, and you can also rent space from cloud providers such as AWS.

Give it a go and let us know what you think! We have other big projects coming down the pipeline soon that will use this public key infrastructure to power some really neat features: a global encrypted filesystem, cryptographically verifiable claims, and more!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fission on the IPFS Community Call]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fission presented what we've been up to on the IPFS Weekly Call on March 9th, 2020.]]></description><link>https://fission-home-gatsby-dev.fission.app/fission-on-the-ipfs-community-call/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5e6687c859c1cc001e896fc2</guid><category><![CDATA[Presentations]]></category><category><![CDATA[IPFS]]></category><category><![CDATA[web native]]></category><category><![CDATA[Community Call]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[FISSION Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 19:34:27 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/03/ipfsbot-twitter-header-community-call.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/03/ipfsbot-twitter-header-community-call.png" alt="Fission on the IPFS Community Call"/><p>Thanks to the IPFS team for hosting us on the weekly community call!

We want to make it as easy to use as any existing Web2 component, while having capabilities at the protocol level – like file de-duplication, a global CDN, peer-to-peer sync, immutability, and offline support, to name a few– that let us empower all developers to build new and interesting tools. </p><p>Fission Drive is the app that we're building to showcase what the entire Fission stack can do, hosted on our own infrastructure. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/icidasset">Steven @icidasset</a> joined the team in December and has been full time since January.

It is particularly associated with C, being found in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programming Language</a></em> (1978), and contrasted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_case">PascalCase</a> (a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">camel case</a>). However, the convention traditionally had no specific name: the Python style guide refers to it simply as "lower_case_with_underscores".<br><br>Within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> the name "snake_case" was first seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a> community in 2004, used by Gavin Kistner<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case</a></br></br></br></br></blockquote><p>This, of course, leads us to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE – all capitals, often used when defining constants. </p><p>And now, a vapourwave inspired illustration:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2020/01/F621DB83-9E43-4C37-B409-2828F22B3ECF.png" class="kg-image" alt="Screaming Snake Case"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We're a developer focused company, which means we have fun with developer-centric in jokes and illustration.

<ul>
<li>Locally: This is done by shelling out to an IPFS daemon that is running on the same machine. This would be the equivalent of running an IPFS command in your terminal.</li>
<li>Remotely: This is done by communicating with a node's HTTP interface. This could either be a node running on the same machine or on another machine.</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The package doesn't currently implement all the IPFS commands, but the base functionality is present: <code>add</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>pin</code>, and <code>dag put</code> (for building IPLD structures).

We've been made obsolete and I don't mean our jobs, I mean ourselves.</strong></p><p>I'm often on planes lately. Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I read or write code, other times I watch an entire season before a decent has begun. I always get from one destination to the next. Typically I'm the same person from take off to landing. Today however, I'm not.</p><p>I was coming back from speaking at <a href="https://www.thebigelixir.com/">The Big Elixir</a> and chewing on a set of conversations I had. One in particular:</p><blockquote>Did you know that you can move people to buy more Pizza just by showing them a certain shade of blue? No no I don't mean blue in the advertisement, I mean blue in general, like funny meme or a cute picture.*</blockquote><p><em>*While I can't cite a conversation, I can cite a few resources that point in this direction. Please read this all and take whatever I'm saying with a grain of salt.</em></p><p>The conversation was wide ranging, interesting, and terrifying. Terrifying for the present and frightening for the future. It was in reference to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/22/the-7-creep-factors-of-online-behavioral-advertising/">A/B testing, at scale, with teams of psychologists and statisticians</a>. Something that's happening right now. And not just at ad agencies. But at government agencies (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/russias-disinformation-war-is-just-getting-started/">as we all know</a>).</p><p>Well-resourced entities working to exploit our own internal systems and invisibly guide our behavior. In ways that aren't obvious or intuitive. Like seeing a colour more often makes you susceptible to a type of food branding much later.</p><p>These changes are small and subtle. But when layered together can be tectonic in shaping your own personal "opinions", "behaviors", "actions" and "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds">emotions</a>".</p><p>What are we if we're not dictating our own thoughts and outcomes? The saying is "I think therefore I am". Should it now be <strong>"I'm statistically significant therefore I'm not"</strong>?</p><p>The concept of this type of manipulation is not new. Yet, like most problems lately, It's the scale and efficiency that is concerning. The more your life that exists online, the more that is tested. The more that is influenced. The more autonomy that you loose. The more your body and your actions are not your own. We have to ask then: What world is this setting us up for?</p><p>Our world is already headed towards a dominant superpower <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/20/20813660/china-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-protests-social-media">not afraid to suppress thoughts and people</a>. With many state actors manipulating your opinions. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump">Trying to change the outcomes of elections</a>. <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html">Creating division and mistrust.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/new-study-snowdens-disclosures-about-nsa-spying-had-a-scary-effect-on-free-speech/">It beckons back to the chilling effect. An observation after the Snowden papers, showing people are less likely to search innocent terms if their government may disapprove.</a> This effectively controls your thoughts. This next level of manipulation, through mass experimentation is just skipping a step. Making sure you never think of the topic at all.</p><p>In the future I do want children but I'm already concerned at the world we're leaving them with. If the last generation gave us a climate crisis, crumbling infrastructure, and a <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/bridgewaters-ray-dalio-says-wealth-gap-is-as-bad-as-the-1930s-20191018">unstable wealth gap</a>. We're going to add a loss of true free will and passing the buck.</p><p>It's unacceptable, it's appalling and we have to do something about it before it's too late. This sounds alarmist, because it is.</p><p>I believe the most important areas for us to be collectively working on is changing our technological systems to work for the people again. Shielding our actions from A/B tests. Letting users be the owners of their data. Censor and monopoly resistant networks. New business models where you don't trade your decision autonomy for feed scrolls.</p><p><strong>Privacy first applications, User controlled data, Open networks, new business models.</strong></p><p>Thankfully we are already seeing the world wake up to this. As a result solutions that address these problems are picking up steam (and users). People are asking what is happening with their data and GDPR is here as a result. <a href="https://blog.rescuetime.com/digital-minimalism/">Others are getting sick of Tech Junk Food</a>: addictive habits that get you to spend far to much time scrolling through endless feeds. Companies that respect your privacy like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/pro-privacy-search-engine-duckduckgo-hits-30m-daily-searches-up-50-in-a-year/">DuckDuckGo are becoming more profitable</a>. Some are <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90174010/bye-chrome-why-im-switching-to-firefox-and-you-should-too">moving to Firefox for privacy</a>. Others are using <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> (a browser which is looking to pay sites in real money and not eyeballs).</p><p>I'm encouraged and energized by this. Similar to how advertising companies and governments layer many small changes to your behavior together. These new customer behaviours are going to add up to a tectonic shift. This time, hopefully, in the right direction. But we still need more people working on this. Doing their part to put the lid back on Pandora's Box.</p><p>Everyone must ask themselves: "Are you OK being obsolete?", "Are you OK not having control over your actions?" and if you're not, then what are you going to do about it?</p><p>After that conversation at The Big Elixir I am more grateful than ever to have the opportunity to do my own part.</p><p>Last month I started working at <a href="https://fission.codes">Fission</a>. It's an ambitious startup building on recent innovations to create the serverless framework of the future. One that can remove intermediary providers, servers and steps in general for a better developer experience. While ensuring users truly own their data and their identity. It's crazy, it's wonderful and it's a move towards the right future. Wish us all luck.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Universal Hostless Substrate for a Post-Serverless Future at Øredev 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Brooke was at Oredev 2019 in Malmo, Sweden and presented a talk covering the evolution of server architecture that we call "hostless".

This also serves as a high level technical roadmap for what we're working on here at Fission. We've shipped IPFS support, and will move on to identity using zero-knowledge proofs and DIDs, and distributed compute with WASM and smart contracts.</p><p>While those are a blizzard of next-gen technology concepts, we're integrating them in such a way as to make them usable and turnkey. The outcome is a better developer experience (DX).</p><p>Key takeaways:</p><ul><li>There has been a 60-year progression of server architecture, and there is one final phase left</li><li>There have been recent advances in cryptography, distributed systems, and web infrastructure</li><li>It is possible to store data and run computation <strong>anywhere</strong>, even on untrusted machines</li><li>Remove the concept of “local development”, “production”, and “deployment” entirely</li></ul><p>The last 60 years has seen the rise and fall of several models of computing: mainframes, private server, shared hosting, containers, and serverless (to name a few). We have one final phase left: “hostless” or universal apps. By leveraging technologies like secure multiparty compute, the content-addressable web, blockchain, and the rise of WASM, we are seeing the beginnings of a future liberated from specialized providers, acting on a distributed substrate of store and compute.</p><p>With all this in place, users fully control their own data (and it never touches your servers), deployment is as simple as setting a flag on your local environment, and developers maintain zero infrastructure.</p><p>Come learn about what is being built today for the next wave of computing, how we evolve past the serverless paradigm, and how it can make life simpler for developers and end users!</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/372223208?app_id=122963" width="426" height="240" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" title="Brooklyn Zelenka - A Universal &amp;quot;Hostless&amp;quot; Substrate for a Post-Serverless Futur | &amp;Oslash;redev 2019"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>The slides are <a href="https://noti.st/expede/I79QlQ/a-universal-hostless-substrate-for-a-post-serverless-future">available on Notist</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Exporting your Facebook photos to Fission]]></title><description><![CDATA[A quick how-to on getting the Facebook export of your photos and videos, and then hosting them on Fission.]]></description><link>https://fission-home-gatsby-dev.fission.app/exporting-your-facebook-photos-to-fission/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Ghost__Post__5dc7cad72c7d24001ef7ff16</guid><category><![CDATA[How To]]></category><category><![CDATA[Facebook]]></category><category><![CDATA[photos]]></category><category><![CDATA[videos]]></category><category><![CDATA[IPFS]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Boris Mann]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2019 09:01:10 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522159698025-071104a1ddbd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522159698025-071104a1ddbd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="Exporting your Facebook photos to Fission"/><p>Facebook has a fairly extensive data export system built in.

It is a quick way to get a static website served up through a regular Web2 domain name.

I've put this on the <a href="https://eth.wiki/en/funding/experiments">Ethereum Wiki</a>, so it can be edited and extended by anyone.</p><p>This is based mainly on funding of software products, from project experiments, mid length R&amp;D, and long-term R&amp;D and maintenance. For any grant project, you'll want to define how you measure success and what the overall impact is that you're looking for.</p><p>Especially in working with crypto currencies, one of the big advantages is that sending them around the world is very simple, compared to what would need to happen to send between arbitrary bank accounts. So, there is low overhead on this aspect from an operational aspect. (At least, for the granting organization – the grantees may have more trouble getting local currency)</p><p>Can we improve the experience by trying to do things very quickly? For example, give out 50 x $1000 grants in 50 days.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/09/brewsters-millions.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Can grant-making be faster and lower overhead?"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The first reaction that people have when I propose giving out grants very quickly, is that I'm crazy (cue <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088850/">"Brewster's Millions"</a> reference).</p><p>Being forced to go fast can highlight the friction points in the process, from project review, to selection, to processing, to follow ups and outcome tracking.</p><p>If you are spending a long time, and using time from multiple people, to decide whether or not to give out a $1000 grant, your overhead of paying those people (or having them volunteer their time), may be more than what the grant is "worth".</p><p>Going fast means necessarily being efficient: working smarter not harder. This might mean a streamlined application process – for example, use an <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> form for project intake, reviewer rating &amp; comments, and final selection. Or using <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a> with Zoom integration for smooth interview scheduling, without any back and forth playing Calendar Tetris – especially where global time zones are involved.</p><p>Don't like my relatively small $1000 grant example? From the <a href="https://eth.wiki/en/funding/experiments">wiki page</a>, I set suggested time frames for decision making and disbursement from application time to decision and disbursement of funds:</p><ul><li>&lt; $50K should take less than 1 month</li><li>&lt; $120K should take less than 2 months</li><li>$120K+ should take no more than 3 months</li></ul><p>I think the benefits of going fast, with many iterations, learning, and optimizations along the way, outweigh any concerns about "waste". You have a tuned grant process, and can use the results and participants in the first round to create a funnel for a next round – larger grants, or longer term funding.</p><p>The story of the <a href="https://excellentjourney.net/2015/03/04/art-fear-the-ceramics-class-and-quantity-before-quality/">ceramics class and quantity before quality</a> is mostly applied to making, or creative works. But the same continuous learning and improvement should be applied to business processes – whether grant-making or coding.</p><p>As someone who has applied for grants, what were your biggest pains around the process?</p><p>As someone involved in giving out or reviewing grants, what areas caused the most friction?

The web2.0 user data model is company (or platform)-centric. This involves locking your data in monolithic company-owned databases, with the end result being that your identity is fragmented and duplicated across a variety of corporate silos. Web3 brings with it a new way of conceptualizing data: a user-centric data model. In this model, a user owns their data and that data can only be read/edited by them and trusted people and apps. Apps take on a different function: they exist as "windows" that a user grants permissions to view or make edits to certain attributes of their data.<br><br>Often, the benefits of web3 technology are put in reactionary terms. That is, it's reacting to the overreaches/missteps of the current corporate stewards of the internet: censorship, sloppy or malicious use of user data, temporality (will I be able to see my photos on Facebook in 25 years? my archived emails on Gmail?), and so on. <br><br>One thing that we aim to do at Fission is not only address the failings of web2, but also create positive reasons to make the jump to web3.</br></br></br></br></p><p>Decentralized apps should be fun and easy for developers to create, and exciting for users to adopt because they offer features not possible in the old web. This was our motivation when developing our Portable User Settings. We wanted to give the intuition behind some of what's possible with web3 and a technical demo that a more robust version could be based on.<br><br>We also wanted to make this app completely p2p. No HTTP gateways required here! If your browser is IPFS-enabled and you're running a local daemon, the app connects to that daemon. If not, it gracefully sets up an in-browser instance of <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs"><code>js-ipfs</code></a>.</br></br></p><p>There are lots of directions this could go. Maybe we want to enable universal dark mode so that all the websites you browse respect your global dark mode setting? Leave a comment on what portable user setting you'd like to see in the world.</p><h2 id="technical-results">Technical Results</h2><p>This project yielded not only a pretty neat demo, but also some useful technical offshoots:<br><br><strong><a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs">get-ipfs</a></strong><br>One of the biggest issues that developers can face when trying to make use of the decentralized web is the high barrier to entry. We wrapped our IPFS fallback functionality into it's own package: <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs">get-ipfs</a>. This is your new one-stop shop for loading an IPFS instance into a webpage. It's as simple as <code>const ipfs = await getIpfs()</code> and you can make direct P2P use of the decentralized web in your webapp. Give it a go and let us know how it works for you!<br><br><strong>Fission JavaScript Client</strong><br>This app was also our first time using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client">Fission JavaScript client</a> in the wild. While adding/getting is done P2P, requests to pin must be sent over HTTP. The library, however, has all the functionality you need to make IPFS-enabled apps over HTTP. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client">library</a> and see what cool uses you can come up with!<br><br><strong>Hosted IPFS Node</strong><br>While we were already hosting an IPFS node, our hosted node is now much more robust. It's capable of handling secure websocket connects (so it can talk to in-browser <code>js-ipfs</code> nodes!) and stores data in S3.

Known differences between the two are tracked in a document managed by the OIDF certification team, found here: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md">https://bitbucket.org/openid/connect/src/default/How-Sign-in-with-Apple-differs-from-OpenID-Connect.md</a>.<br><br>The current set of differences between OpenID Connect and Sign In with Apple reduces the places where users can use Sign In with Apple and exposes them to greater security and privacy risks.

Now, they're revitalizing the Nanaimo tech scene by purchasing and relaunching the local coworking space as <a href="http://inputcowork.com/">Input Cowork</a> – <a href="https://v2.nanaimonewsnow.com/article/607597/nanaimo-startup-aims-reboot-support-local-tech-scene">read more about their February 2019 launch in the Nanaimo News</a>.</p><h3 id="distributed-working">Distributed Working</h3><p><a href="http://blairreeves.me/2018/11/09/dont-work-remotely/">Blair Reeves has a good article titled <u>Don't work "remotely"</u></a> that insists that we should be calling this distributed working.</p><blockquote>But one largely overlooked obstacle to the adoption of “remote” working is the popular conception of how it actually works, the root of which has to do with all the quotation marks you’ve seen here so far. The term “remote” work itself implies tasks being done at arm’s length, and at some critical remove between object and subject. I’m here, and “the work” is over there, in other words. Like anywhere, this framing is critical. And it’s also mostly wrong. Don’t adopt “remote” working. Adopt <u>distributed work</u>.</blockquote><p>At FISSION, we work as a distributed team. So, while Brooke and I are both physically based in Vancouver right now, it does mean we have the flexibility to work from anywhere. Last year, I hosted a coworking on Bowen Island day, where a group of us took a boat from Coal Harbour direct to Bowen Island, and worked out of the library and community centre, and took a boat back at the end of the day.</p><p>So, we're going to take a day trip to Nanaimo!</p><h3 id="vancouver-to-nanaimo-coworking-day">Vancouver to Nanaimo Coworking Day</h3><p>Are you in Vancouver and want to do a one day coworking and meetup adventure over to Nanaimo and back?</p><p>We'll spend the day working out of Input Cowork, getting to know Nanaimo, and then attending the tech meetup in the evening.</p><p>Leave a comment below and we'll coordinate seaplane flights and ferry rides.

ETHNewYork was the first hackathon run in NYC by ETHglobal, an organisation dedicated to onboarding new Ethereum developers. First we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION asked the team about their background and hackathon experience.</p><p>Hackathon Devpost: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx">https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx</a></p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app">https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id="how-y3-works">How Y3 works</h3><p>The name originated as an aspirational take on where video platforms might head in our distributed future. If Youtube (Y2) is a legacy system that can censor users and withhold payments for content, Y3 is an exploration towards a future where new possibilities open up. Self-hosted, replicated content can't be taken down, and payments over Ethereum are censorship resistant to a high degree.</p><p>The first step for users is to be running or have access to an IPFS node. After loading their content into the <a href="https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs">IPFS interface</a>, users submit a content hash to the Y3 onchain Ethereum contract. The video metadata gets stored in a contract array to be accessed later by users.</p><p>Payment, if required, would be handled via a Python script, conditional upon successful delivery of content from the IPFS network. The contract would then call a function that sets up the transaction. This is one thing that still needs to be developed for the project to operate properly. According to Kian,  this kind of payment scheme wouldn't be practical in reality: </p><blockquote>Instead, an implementation of either state channels or probabilistic micropayments –with the total time of video content already streamed taken to be the primary metric for payment – would be more apt.</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HLS</a> (HTTP Live Streaming) and <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/">IPNS</a> (InterPlanetary Naming System) integrations are also still under development. For now, Y3 can only serve static content. IPNS would make those links mutable, and would update the content address as new chunks of data come in.</p><p>Other important libraries used are <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/">web3.JS</a>, <a href="https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/makeRequests.md">Infura's API</a> for Ethereum integration, and <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> for HLS capable video editing.</p><p>In the future, Kian would like to add a more intuitive frontend. The FISSION team is looking forward to seeing where the project ends up and what functions he can integrate!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-19.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Interviews: Y3"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Finally, here are a few additional questions we had Kian answer about his background and the hackathon itself:</p><p><strong>What’s your background as a developer?</strong></p><p>I’m currently 21, and so I’m still pursuing my undergrad. As an Engineering Physics major, I’m not left with a lot of time during the semester to develop Ethereum-related projects, but do develop data processing and machine learning software professionally. When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the decentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I’ve been to two ETHGlobal events, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech — a decentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation application.</p><p><strong>What got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?</strong></p><p>I along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of mouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies. Out of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my colleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these popular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for ourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical and worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a heightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and cutting-edge developments in the space.</p><p><strong>Where do you go to read tech news / developer news?</strong></p><p>For tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is a very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very active on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the result is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel concepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you’re forced to judge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out, while the upside is that you’re exposed to ideas soon after they’re born.</p><p><strong>In general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?</strong></p><p>One of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of sponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful and exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers present, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.</p><p><strong>What inspired Y3?</strong></p><p>A video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized technologies where the benefits are very obvious to see – you don’t have go through leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a platform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that we’ve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all kinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly engaging. This luxury, however, isn’t afforded to the billions of people around the world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency. Thus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the pursuit of its realization is noble.</p><p><strong>What made you want to integrate IPFS?</strong></p><p>IPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store the contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution, it was fairly elegant – the only major disadvantage being the lack of persistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being addressed by developers of the protocol.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?</strong></p><p>Connecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate Python client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest challenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for HLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate of incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network connectivity).</p><p><strong>What was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon participants?</strong></p><p>After expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly integrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from Livepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their projects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to IPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents periodically.</p><p><strong>Any plans to keep working on the project?</strong></p><p>Yes. My application does not completely function as intended. I will finish properly implementing HLS functionality and then go on to share the project online.</p><p><strong>In hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the project or the hackathon?</strong></p><p>I actually anticipated the issue that I had regarding the implementation of HLS functionality with IPFS before I even started the project. In hindsight, I should have sought out a solution to my problem well before I ever encountered it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-18.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Interviews: Y3"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><br>Thanks Kian for spending time to help get this post ready for others to learn from.

Given the ever present challenges related to privacy, database breaches and platform lock-in, it's crucial to begin returning data autonomy back to users. </p><p>For this issue, we're diving into <a href="https://twitter.com/icidasset">Steven Vandevelde</a>'s Diffuse: a music player that connects to your cloud/distributed music storage. First we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION asking about Steven's background.</p><p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse">https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse</a></p><p>Try it out yourself: <a href="https://diffuse.sh/">https://diffuse.sh</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><strong>How does Diffuse work</strong></p><p>The basic idea is that users should be able to access music files they own from anywhere, even local content.  This ranges from cloud servers like Dropbox or Google Drive to distributed storage solutions like IPFS. Steven has been iterating on Diffuse, <a href="https://elm-lang.org/">written in Elm</a>, for over 6 years now. The Diffuse <a href="https://diffuse.sh/about/">About</a> page also has some good information.</p><p>There are three main pieces to the product: the <strong>user data storage,</strong> the <strong>file</strong> <strong>storage medium, </strong>and<strong> </strong>the <strong>frontend</strong> which sits between them both. </p><p>To start a user would navigate to <a href="https://diffuse.sh">diffuse.sh</a>, no need to install anything. In the current V1, users can authenticate themselves through <a href="https://blockstack.org/">Blockstack</a>, <a href="https://remotestorage.io/">Remote Storage</a> or use the product anonymously via the browser.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-11.26.10.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Interviews: Diffuse"><figcaption>here's what the user sees first</figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Using a proper authentication method allows users to save things like music metadata, user favourites, and settings, whereas an "anonymous" login may result in data loss if the browser is cleared. Once they have been authenticated, users are able to add new content or access previously added content. </p><p>The user facing front-end is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. Further down the decentralisation spectrum, it's certainly possible to self-host the frontend by downloading the html and mimicking Netlify (check this IPFS + ENS site <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/ENSIPFS-Part-1-Introduction.html">hosting tutorial</a>). </p><p>Here's an example of what would happen under the hood for a file hosted on Google Drive. Once a user authenticates on Diffuse and requests to add a file, they will be logged into their Google account and asked to allow permissions to the Diffuse app. Once granted, the app will request that Drive construct a filetree, which is a list containing the path to every audio file. It works in chunks of 1000 files requested from each url and then gets the music tags/metadata from each file via the <a href="https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags">JSmediatags library</a>. The parsed metadata from those files is then cached in a user's storage provider: in V1 this is limited to either Blockstack or RemoteStorage. That way, when a user logs in and any metadata from previously loaded music is already there.</p><p>Once music on the storage medium has been identified and the metadata cached, the app users can enjoy whatever music files they have saved. Content searching is facilitated by the <a href="https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/">Lunr library</a>.</p><p>A V2 is already in the works to make the entire product more user friendly. This next version will have data encryption, and even more storage options, including <a href="https://textile.io/">Textile</a> for user data, or <a href="https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/overview.html">Blockstack's Gaia</a> for file access. Fission is looking forward to when the V2 is live hopefully later this summer. We'll plan to do a blog post then detailing any of the updates.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Finally, here's a set of questions we asked Steven.</p><p><strong>What’s your background as a developer?</strong></p><p>Started with web dev as a hobby when I was 15 (I’m 29 now). First gig was for a web agency, mainly doing small artsy websites and a cms using ruby. Four years later I started working for another agency, but mainly doing app development. I've been doing all kinds of dev things in my spare time, but my main side project for the last 8 years has been Diffuse and its predecessors.</p><p><strong>Where do you go to read tech news / developer news?</strong></p><p>Twitter, email newsletters, slack/discord channels</p><p><strong>What first inspired Diffuse?</strong></p><p>Someone asked me to build a UI for <a href="https://github.com/trevorturk/kzak">https://github.com/trevorturk/kzak</a>, and at the same time I was collecting music. Seemed like an interesting idea and fun to work on. Also, I used Spotify for a while, but they kept silently removing some of my favourite music, after that I never turned back.</p><p><strong>How has user testing gone?</strong></p><p>Could be better. People like the design, made a few feature requests, but never really expressed what could be better. That said, Blockstack recently put Diffuse on <a href="https://www.trymyui.com/">https://www.trymyui.com/</a> which has given me good feedback.</p><p><strong>Where have you gotten the bulk of your users?</strong></p><p>IPFS forum, <a href="https://electronjs.org/apps/diffuse">https://electronjs.org/apps/diffuse</a> and chinese/japanese blogs about IPFS. I think… I don’t have any analytics except on Github, so I don’t really know.</p><p><strong>What was the most useful feedback you’ve received?</strong></p><p>“I don’t know how to use this”</p><p><strong>What is the benefit of using Blockstack? Drawbacks?</strong></p><p>Easy decentralized authentication. Drawback, way too much javascript, bad performance.</p><p><strong>If you were to redesign or reset your structure what would you have done differently?</strong></p><p>I’m currently working on V2, which is built from scratch. So this’ll be easy to answer 😄 I like the design very much so that stayed the same, just more fine tuned, more attention to detail. Structure has improved as well, better performance, moved more things on the web-worker side, easier to extend (build on).</p><p><strong>What challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?</strong></p><p> I don’t really remember the music-storage integration, was over a year ago. But I think it went pretty smoothly, except for a CORS issue which was later resolved in go-ipfs. I recently did IPFS “authentication”, or in other words user-data storage, which is the unpublished work-in-progress V2. That was more challenging, I had to find a good way to encrypt the user’s data.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Thanks Steven for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn from.

There is a world within reach where always-on, always-connected pocket computers become personal data stores. All your photos, documents, messages, and other data live with you, not on a faceless server belonging to a random corporation. The only machine learning done is done for you. Data only leaves your device because you want to send it somewhere.</blockquote><p>The author is careful to balance this aspirational scenario with what are genuine challenges. It will take significant work to realise this vision, including rethinking the current internet hub-and-spoke model, increasing adoption of IPv6, opening up radio spectrums, and extensive user education. Though daunting, these are not insurmountable: the activists' best ally is a dogged preference for incremental progress over time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Have you ever tried to host your own site through with ENS + IPFS? <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinerX">Timur</a> pointed us to a <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/list-of_ENSIPFS-websites.html"><strong>List of ENS+IPFS websites</strong></a><strong> </strong>that have done this successfully, including the blog at the link<strong>.</strong> Also check out this great <a href="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/ENSIPFS-Part-1-Introduction.html">series of tutorials</a> detailing how to do it for yourself!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-06.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Fragments #4: Weekly Links Roundup"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><blockquote>Almonit.club is hosted like a normal website.

First we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION asked the team about their background.</br></br></p><p>Hackathon Devpost: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/0xsu-ethereum-short-urls">https://devpost.com/software/0xsu-ethereum-short-urls</a></p><p>GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/du4e">https://github.com/du4e</a></p><h3 id="how-0xsu-works">How 0xSU works</h3><p>"Think of it like goo.gl except it can't be taken down." In theory, URL shorteners could censor a link or decline to continue forwarding requests. By deploying to the public Ethereum chain, creating open source proxy servers and utilising a distributed storage layer like IPFS, much of that risk is avoided. </p><p>Before using 0xSU, users need to make sure they have either a traditional web-browser like Chrome plus wallet extension (ie <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>) or through a Web3 browser like <a href="https://status.im/">Status</a> or <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Wallet</a>. If that's ready, they can navigate to <a href="https://0xsu.co/">0xSU.co</a> with the URL they want to shorten and store immutably. The web3 frontend is hosted through IPFS, meaning everything needed to make this work properly already exists outside of a centralised server. Currently, the node is hosted through Digital Ocean.</p><p>Once on the site, users submit the link along with a small amount of Ether to cover associated gas costs. Under the hood, the link is written into the contract (<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x19624ffa41fe26744e74fdbba77bef967a222d4c">address on Etherscan</a>) as a key value pair: the full link and the shortened one. The backend sits onchain in the contract, accessed via either a <a href="https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-js-lib">helper js library</a> or one of the open source <a href="http://0xsu.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xsu.co</a> proxy servers: <a href="https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-flask-server">flask</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-sinatra-server">sinatra</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-express-server">express</a>.<br><br>Additionally, the url shortener doesn't work without an http redirect, so they wrote open source forwarding proxies that enable this and anyone can run. The project currently uses <a href="https://quiknode.io/">Quiknode</a> as the Web3 provider to supply a node that the forwarders can hook into.</br></br></p><p>Given that the code is open source, anyone could fork the front end and run their own forwarding instance. In the future, users could get served ads to offset the cost of forwarding. Alternatively, the team is also looking at integrating the <a href="https://medium.com/groundhog-network/the-gas-station-network-alliance-6fd543e7eca3">Gas Station Network</a>, a collaboration between Ethereum organisations that cover the cost of gas for onboarding new users and subsidised apps.</p><p>In the future, the project will have to consider the implications of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arw0au/what_is_state_rent_in_ethereum_and_how_does_it/">state rent</a>. Users, or the Gas Station Network might have to provide an additional payment to wake a dormant contract back into state. A partial workaround for this could be to cache the high traffic URLs in something like Heroku. </p><p>Future UI improvements might include adding a <a href="https://www.sendwyre.com/">Wyre</a> integration to allow users to use credit cards instead of maintaining a compatible wallet. The team hopes to continue working on it as a side project.</p><p>Here's a quick video demo of 0xSU in action:</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/55JN4GWSR8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""/></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Finally, here's a set of questions we had the team answer:</p><p><strong>What is your developer background?</strong></p><p>Jon: I graduated from a full-stack coding bootcamp about a month ago. Before that I just dabbled a little with JavaScript.</p><p>Auston: I am a self-taught developer who started writing code about 12 years ago. I am always interested in learning new languages &amp; Solidity / Ethereum are super powerful conceptually. </p><p><strong>What got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralisation initially? </strong></p><p>Jon: I found the idea of the blockchain and its serverless application fascinating. I wanted to learn more and my research told me the Ethereum network is the best run place to start.</p><p>Auston: For me it started in 2011 when my friend Michael had a little hacker meetup &amp; decided to talk about bitcoin. I dismissed it initially but eventually came around to the idea. Finally my friend Kai reached out in 2017 &amp; told me about Ethereum, that’s when I really started to dive deep, as I realized there was now a censorship resistant platform that could be built upon.</p><p><strong>Where do you go to read tech news / developer news?</strong></p><p>Jon: hackernoon, medium, techcrunch, <a href="http://dev.to/" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev.to</a></p><p>Auston: I love hacker news! Twitter is always fun to discover random things &amp; on occasion, Hacker Noon. </p><p><strong>Do you listen to any technology or developer podcasts?</strong></p><p>Jon: I would if I found the time.</p><p>Auston: Shill time! I have been working on a podcast for a few weeks with my friend Jose, you can go listen to it on the <a href="https://devshirts.co/blogs/podcasts">Devshirts' site</a>.</p><p><strong>In general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?</strong></p><p>Jon: Was pretty interesting and inspiring. It was my first time and I didn’t know where to begin, but luckily I teamed up with Auston who is a nice guy &amp; helped guide me.</p><p>Auston: It was really invigorating to see so many people hyped up about Ethereum &amp; working on Dapps. I definitely appreciated the sponsor dev support, we launched a node on <a href="http://quiknode.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quiknode.io</a> and got some help from then <a href="http://sendwyre.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">sendwyre.com</a> team. Also was super cool to get some help from Vitalik himself debugging an issue with our smart contract. </p><p><strong>What inspired the project? </strong></p><p><a href="http://goo.gl/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goo.gl</a> had been taken down which is a shame because it was a useful service, and we wanted to make sure that couldn’t happen again by using the blockchain.</p><p><strong>What made you want to integrate IPFS? </strong></p><p>Auston: IPFS is a project I’ve known about since 2017 that again I thought would be a super awesome way to distribute copies of content on.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?</strong></p><p>Auston: None really, it was actually super easy for the most part. However I had to find a guide that showed me to how to point a domain at the IPFS node.</p><p><strong>What was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon participants?</strong></p><p>There were other apps and apis that could make what we did cheaper and faster, but we kept it simple. Also the positive attitude of the judges was really nice to have, they were really onboard with the fact that we deployed to main net, etc. </p><p><strong>Any plans to keep working on the project? </strong></p><p>Would definitely love to integrate Stripe to make it possible to pay for link shortening with a credit/debit card, get more people running a forwarding server &amp; perhaps integrate the gas station network to let people pay with BAT or by watching ads.</p><p><strong>In hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the project or the hackathon?</strong></p><p>Auston: Jon would have liked to integrate more sponsors, but I’m actually really happy with the outcome. </p><p><strong>Any side projects or interests you would like to shill?</strong></p><p>Auston: Definitely <a href="http://quiknode.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">quiknode.io</a> as well as <a href="http://0xsu.co/" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xsu.co</a> - you should try both and run a forwarding server!!</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Thanks Jon &amp; Auston for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn from.

Semantics are important!</p><blockquote>The fork button on GitHub - with the little number next to it for depositing dopamine into your brain - is a bit misleading. GitHub co-opted the meaning of “fork” to trick you into participating in their platform more. They did this in a well-intentioned way, for the sake of their pull requests feature, but ultimately this design is self-serving and causes some friction when contributors venture out of their GitHub sandbox and into the rest of the software development ecosystem. Let’s clarify what “fork” really means, and what we do without GitHub’s concept of one - for it is in this difference that we truly discover how git is a <em><em>distributed</em></em> version control system.</blockquote><p>Cloudflare has produced a very thorough tutorial that dives into <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-a-to-do-list-with-workers-and-kv/">Building a To-Do List with Workers and KV</a>. </p><blockquote>In this tutorial, we’ll build a todo list application in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with a twist: all the data should be stored inside of the newly-launched Workers KV, and the application itself should be served directly from Cloudflare’s edge network, using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/">Cloudflare Workers</a>.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Fragments #3: Weekly Links Roundup"><figcaption>From the Cloudflare tutorial</figcaption></img></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Etherscan, a blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, released a new front-end tool for dapp developers.</p><blockquote>Etherscan Dapp page provides a front-end interface with a custom URL (using Ethereum name service) for any smart contract on Ethereum.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="FISSION Fragments #3: Weekly Links Roundup"/></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><em>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@cass4504">Cassie Matias</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/Wgjlk0Lo7-A">Unsplash</a></em></p></hr></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[FISSION Fragments 2: Weekly Links Roundup]]></title><description><![CDATA[Second edition of our weekly links from around the decentralised web.

From my recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot about the topics covered.</p><p>I feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the “Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming more traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.</p><p>Alexey’s <a href="https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60">article about Eth1x</a> highlights this shift well: a shift in <em>who</em> works on research and implementation, and a shift in <em>how</em> the process is changing and needs to continue to evolve.</p><blockquote>Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation teams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group and start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires finding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But at least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable process.<br><br>— <a href="https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60">Alexey Akhunov</a></br></br></blockquote><p>In other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes <em>after</em> growth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the <a href="https://ethereum.foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a> actively divest itself of core responsibilities.</p><p>Oh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years still co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.</p><p>If I could, I would want to get up on stage at <a href="https://devcon.org">DevCon5</a> and essentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.</p><p>Here are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:</p><h3 id="becoming-open-source">Becoming Open Source</h3><p>Ethereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need to spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and iteratively making things better.</p><p>What does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that get assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.</p><p>Every day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying cry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er” mindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei</p><p>I am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository norms (issues &amp; PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source experience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue, bettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new code contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.</p><h3 id="open-source-licensing-funding-isn-t-a-solved-problem">Open Source Licensing &amp; Funding isn’t a Solved Problem</h3><p>Open source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning from other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead in experiments in these areas.</p><p>Open source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There is a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down adoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around open source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate revenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.</p><p>Funding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say that only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project tradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate open source awareness into their thinking.</p><h3 id="embrace-the-ethereum-stack">Embrace the Ethereum Stack</h3><p>I’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC middleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language, the EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of these are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and collaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains, sidechains, and private enterprise contexts.</p><p>This is a strength <strong>if</strong> we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum. While still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the entire stack can benefit from and link into.</p><p>The Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and supporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.</p><p>We’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog for Ethereum Stack) on the <a href="https://RUNEVM.com">RUN EVM site</a>.

This is why I want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other language developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is, it’s not duplication, it’s forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for other language compatibility as well).</p><h3 id="mobile-as-a-programming-environment">Mobile as a Programming Environment</h3><p>Personally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for Ethereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the same “make Ethereum programming work from your phone” opportunity and threat highlighted by Russell.</p><p>Since Ethereum chains run continuously as a global “backend” — I see this as an opportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written &amp; deployed from mobile devices today — with Ethereum blockchains providing a shared backend. This is connected to the “hostless” theme that we are following at FISSION.</p><h2 id="what-should-we-work-on">What should we work on?</h2><p>The entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open source, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.</p><p>Here are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum community can work on:</p><ol><li>Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.</li><li>Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.</li></ol><p>FISSION’s mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider development community by solving real problems today &amp; exploring fundamental shifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans. I look forward to completing this mission alongside the growth of the Ethereum community.</p><p><a href="https://tools.fission.codes">Sign up if you want to get involved as an alpha tester »</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><p>I haven’t read Elisabeth Ostrom’s 1990 book, “Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action“.

Are we doomed to the excesses of fraudulent ICOs, IEOs,  of privacy destroying data extraction until the heat-death of the universe?</p><p><strong>The short answer is no, of course not.</strong></p><p>First, let’s step back and look around a bit more broadly — Why do some people think Web3 has been abandoned in favor of things like DeFi? (Decentralised Finance if you aren’t familiar: financial instruments like <a href="https://www.dharma.io/" rel="noopener">Dharma</a>, <a href="https://www.setprotocol.com/" rel="noopener">Set</a>, <a href="https://compound.finance/" rel="noopener">Compound</a>)</p><p>In a phrase, product-market fit happened. Look at the following points:</p><ol><li>the 2017 bull market left those that sold the top flush with new cash.</li><li>DeFi products have matured enough over 2018 and the beignning of 2019 to have functioning releases. These are relatively straightforward protocols that have engaged user bases, monetisation paths, etc.</li><li>Web3 (including Swarm, IPFS, Whisper and the coordination protocols building on top of them) was always a long term, more complex objective.</li><li>Novel ways of organising human effort is a big task to see through. DAOs like those from <a href="https://aragon.org/" rel="noopener">Aragon</a>, <a href="https://colony.io/" rel="noopener">Colony</a>, <a href="https://daostack.io/" rel="noopener">Daostack</a> are going to need a lot more tooling and experimentation, which is fortunately happening today.</li></ol><p>Ethereum still has a relatively small community, so it’s easy to get stuck in a narrative bubble. And while narratives are important for uniting communities, no single group can control what ends up being built, whether that's a dapp for managing your collateralised loan or a DAO for your co-op. </p><h3 id="web3-vision-outside-of-crypto">WEB3 VISION OUTSIDE OF CRYPTO</h3><p>The reality is that outside of Ethereum mainchain there are dev communities interested in data sovereignty — it’s just referred to by different names, including local-first software, hostless &amp; local compute.</p><p>Developers interested in these types of constructions often have similar motivations as the Web3 community; user privacy, distributed collaboration, aversion to corporate data mining. IPFS has seen growth both within and without crypto through developers passionate about these ideals.</p><p>The Ink &amp; Switch team recently posted <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">a great writeup on what they call local-first software</a>:</p><blockquote>In this article we propose “local-first software”: a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration <em><em>and</em></em> ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data.</blockquote><p>The authors include a list of <strong>7 benefits</strong> that come from using local-first solutions, which will resonate with the crypto community:</p><ol><li>No spinners: your work at your fingertips</li><li>Your work is not trapped on one device</li><li>The network is optional</li><li>Seamless collaboration with colleagues</li><li>The Long Now — able to access and edit over extended timelines</li><li>Security and privacy by default</li><li>You retain ultimate control</li></ol><p>Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9fdyDlhByM" rel="noopener">demo of a sample app called Trellis</a> that duplicates Trello functionality onto a offline machine. Distributed teams working on the same board can then be synced to a canonical version, all without using a cloud provider.</p><p>The discussion within the Ethereum community continues of course – there are dapps and protocols being built around decentralized web use cases, while financial use cases continue to grow as well.</p><h3 id="working-with-fission">Working with FISSION</h3><p>I’ve recently begun working with the team at <a href="https://fission.codes">FISSION</a>. My background is in architecture and design, but I will be helping FISSION with everything from developer relations, operations, research, communications, and of course, sticker distribution! </p><p>I first discovered Ethereum through reddit in 2015, having no previous exposure to the worlds of Open Source Software and cryptocurrencies. I've gotten pulled deeper and deeper of the intervening years and am excited to finally be working in an ecosystem I see as having tremendous impact both in the short term and far into the future. </p><p>Just as DeFi has taken off due to emergent conditions, transitioning Web2 devs to Web3 tools will be an effort in meeting people where they are. Meaning don’t try to force use cases before they are ready, support devs where they are interested in spending their time, and generally use Web3 tech to solve real problems.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>The first tool that FISSION is working on releasing is built around IPFS: getting websites and files published peer-to-peer to the decentralized web, right from your laptop.
