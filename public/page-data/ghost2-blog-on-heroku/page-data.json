This is used only for account invites and\npassword resets, just remember to whitelist the email address before inviting\nnew staff.\n\nCustom Domain and SSL Known Issues\nWhen switching to a custom domain, PUBLIC_URL  needs to be set. Ghost won't pick\nup this new URL until a Heroku redeploy happens (even though no code changes\nhappen). This is a known issue, and you need to manually redeploy for Ghost to\npick up the change. See issue fission-ghost/1\n[https://github.com/bmann/fission-ghost/issues/1]\n\nIf you're using Cloudflare for your DNS and are setting a custom domain with\nSSL, you may run into an issue with infinite redirects. This is a known issue\nwith the \"Flexible\" SSL setting on Cloudflare, and you'll need to turn off\nCloudflare proxying for the custom domain you're pointing at Heroku. See issue \nfission-ghost/2 [https://github.com/bmann/fission-ghost/issues/2]\n\nIf you find any other issues, please file an issue\n[https://github.com/bmann/fission-ghost/issues], or come chat to us in our \nDiscord server [https://discord.gg/daDMAjE].\n\nIPFS Support & Future Research\nSince we're using Ghost to run our own (this!) blog, we're going to put creating\nan IPFS Storage Adapter for Ghost on our roadmap.\n\nGhost supports SQLite as a database option. Since this is a file based database,\nthis could theoretically be hosted on IPFS.\n\nUsing Ghost to author content and then publish it in flat file mode for IPFS\npublishing, or to have an IPFS version of each blog post are other interesting\nareas of exploration.\n\nLet us know if you have other ideas for Ghost + IPFS!","html":"<p><a href=\"https://ghost.org/\">Ghost</a> is blogging software written in Node.js. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cobyism\">Coby Chapple @cobyism</a> did the original hard work and got <a href=\"https://github.com/cobyism/ghost-on-heroku\">Ghost 1.x running on Heroku</a>.</p><p>I forked this repo and updated the <code>package.json</code> to refer to the latest versions of Ghost 2.x, the Casper default theme, and the Amazon S3 storage adapter.</p><p>It's now running this blog, so we know it works!</p><p>You can use this Deploy to Heroku button to create a Ghost 2 blog now:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href=\"https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bmann/fission-ghost\"><img src=\"https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg\" alt=\"Deploy\"></a></p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You will need to have or create Amazon S3 credentials for file uploads to work, and you'll probably want to setup a custom domain, but your blog should be up and running and you can create your first user.</p><p>With the Mailgun add-on, you're using sandbox mode which can only send to email addresses that agree to receive email.
