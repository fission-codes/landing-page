Look at the following points:\n\n 1. the 2017 bull market left those that sold the top flush with new cash.\n 2. DeFi products have matured enough over 2018 and the beignning of 2019 to\n    have functioning releases. These are relatively straightforward protocols\n    that have engaged user bases, monetisation paths, etc.\n 3. Web3 (including Swarm, IPFS, Whisper and the coordination protocols building\n    on top of them) was always a long term, more complex objective.\n 4. Novel ways of organising human effort is a big task to see through. DAOs\n    like those from Aragon [https://aragon.org/], Colony [https://colony.io/], \n    Daostack [https://daostack.io/]  are going to need a lot more tooling and\n    experimentation, which is fortunately happening today.\n\nEthereum still has a relatively small community, so it’s easy to get stuck in a\nnarrative bubble. And while narratives are important for uniting communities, no\nsingle group can control what ends up being built, whether that's a dapp for\nmanaging your collateralised loan or a DAO for your co-op. \n\nWEB3 VISION OUTSIDE OF CRYPTO\nThe reality is that outside of Ethereum mainchain there are dev communities\ninterested in data sovereignty — it’s just referred to by different names,\nincluding local-first software, hostless & local compute.\n\nDevelopers interested in these types of constructions often have similar\nmotivations as the Web3 community; user privacy, distributed collaboration,\naversion to corporate data mining. IPFS has seen growth both within and without\ncrypto through developers passionate about these ideals.\n\nThe Ink & Switch team recently posted a great writeup on what they call\nlocal-first software [https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html]:\n\n> In this article we propose “local-first software”: a set of principles for\nsoftware that enables both collaboration and  ownership for users. Local-first\nideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple\ndevices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and\nuser control of data.\nThe authors include a list of 7 benefits  that come from using local-first\nsolutions, which will resonate with the crypto community:\n\n 1. No spinners: your work at your fingertips\n 2. Your work is not trapped on one device\n 3. The network is optional\n 4. Seamless collaboration with colleagues\n 5. The Long Now — able to access and edit over extended timelines\n 6. Security and privacy by default\n 7. You retain ultimate control\n\nHere’s a demo of a sample app called Trellis\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9fdyDlhByM]  that duplicates Trello\nfunctionality onto a offline machine. Distributed teams working on the same\nboard can then be synced to a canonical version, all without using a cloud\nprovider.\n\nThe discussion within the Ethereum community continues of course – there are\ndapps and protocols being built around decentralized web use cases, while\nfinancial use cases continue to grow as well.\n\nWorking with FISSION\nI’ve recently begun working with the team at FISSION [https://fission.codes]. My\nbackground is in architecture and design, but I will be helping FISSION with\neverything from developer relations, operations, research, communications, and\nof course, sticker distribution! \n\nI first discovered Ethereum through reddit in 2015, having no previous exposure\nto the worlds of Open Source Software and cryptocurrencies. I've gotten pulled\ndeeper and deeper of the intervening years and am excited to finally be working\nin an ecosystem I see as having tremendous impact both in the short term and far\ninto the future. \n\nJust as DeFi has taken off due to emergent conditions, transitioning Web2 devs\nto Web3 tools will be an effort in meeting people where they are. Meaning don’t\ntry to force use cases before they are ready, support devs where they are\ninterested in spending their time, and generally use Web3 tech to solve real\nproblems.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first tool that FISSION is working on releasing is built around IPFS:\ngetting websites and files published peer-to-peer to the decentralized web,\nright from your laptop.
