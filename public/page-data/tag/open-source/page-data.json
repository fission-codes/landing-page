Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system\nknown as \"Zettlekasten,\" and how you can use Fission and TiddlyWiki\n[https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/]to create your own\nversion. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and\npublished more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.\n\nThis is Niklas LuhmannNiklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive\nbadass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking\nmethod he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words,\nZettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means\nslip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is\nabout creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.\n\nHow Zettelkasten works\nTo use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:\n\n * A way to take notes\n * A system with bidirectional linking\n * A collection of tags\n\nThat’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.\n\nA note-taking system\nLuhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a\ntypewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very\nquickly--he used the hunt and peck method.\n\nIn fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of\nfurniture--sort of like a card catalog.\n\nNot Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea\n\nWhile Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of\npaper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital\nnote-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep\noffer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices.\nTiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power,\nwhich is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.\n\nA system with bidirectional linking\nSo what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability\nto connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One\npopular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam\nResearch; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free,\nopen-source program.\n\nA collection of tags\nThe last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for\nyour thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts\nor online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps,\nopen-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing\nyour ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a\nnote-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you\ncan easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.\n\nUsing TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten\nThe great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to\nuse the Zettelkasten system.\n\n 1. A note-taking method.\n 2. Bidirectional linking\n 3. A system of Tags\n\nTiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries\ncalled “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open\nsource, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:\n\n\n\nLet’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this\none, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our\nTiddlers come up in the search results:\n\n\n\nTiddlyWiki and Fission\nAs you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your\nnotes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a\nversion of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web\nnative option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the\nbenefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and\nbidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your\nZettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and\nprotected.\n\nWe are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the \nTiddlyWiki\ngroup on the Fission forum [https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  to\nkeep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for\nFission later this spring!\n\nAlso, check out the Fission Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277], where we\nare having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects\nand all things open source.

Python is 28 years old, and\nthe context is — how does it stay relevant for the next 10 years? How does it\nplan to do things, to remain relevant? And what “black swan” events does Python\nneed to be prepared for?\n\nThe essential topic is, Python has been around for 28 years; how does it make\nsure it stays around for 10 more years? Covers “black swan” events, open source\ncommunity norms, WASM, volunteerism vs. funding experts, contributor burn out,\nand more.\n\nTake Aways for Ethereum\nA lot of this is familiar to be me because I have a long history with open\nsource projects. But, that’s history: one big point is that we need to be\nthinking about — and planning for! — the future of collaborative projects. From\nmy recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot\nabout the topics covered.\n\nI feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the\n“Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming\nmore traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.\n\nAlexey’s article about Eth1x\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60] \n highlights this shift well: a shift in who  works on research and\nimplementation, and a shift in how  the process is changing and needs to\ncontinue to evolve.\n\n> Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation\nteams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group\nand start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires\nfinding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But\nat least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable\nprocess.\n\n— Alexey Akhunov\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60]\nIn other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes after \ngrowth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the Ethereum Foundation\n[https://ethereum.foundation]  actively divest itself of core responsibilities.\n\nOh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years\nstill co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.\n\nIf I could, I would want to get up on stage at DevCon5 [https://devcon.org]  and\nessentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.\n\nHere are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:\n\nBecoming Open Source\nEthereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need\nto spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and\niteratively making things better.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that\nget assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.\n\nEvery day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying\ncry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er”\nmindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei\n\nI am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository\nnorms (issues & PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source\nexperience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue,\nbettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new\ncode contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.\n\nOpen Source Licensing & Funding isn’t a Solved Problem\nOpen source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning\nfrom other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead\nin experiments in these areas.\n\nOpen source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There\nis a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down\nadoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around\nopen source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate\nrevenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.\n\nFunding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say\nthat only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project\ntradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate\nopen source awareness into their thinking.\n\nEmbrace the Ethereum Stack\nI’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC\nmiddleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language,\nthe EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of\nthese are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and\ncollaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains,\nsidechains, and private enterprise contexts.\n\nThis is a strength if  we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum.\nWhile still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the\nentire stack can benefit from and link into.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and\nsupporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.\n\nWe’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog\nfor Ethereum Stack) on the RUN EVM site [https://RUNEVM.com]. And yet, I was\nstill surprised to see ThoughtWorks Radar highlight “EVM beyond Ethereum”\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link]\n; it’s in their “Trial” category, one before “Adopt” recommendation.\n\nEVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms]Ethereum’s Black Swans\nWhat disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might\naffect Ethereum? Even while thinking about distributed ledger technology and\nrelated decentralized web tech as a disruption itself, we need to look at how\nthe Ethereum stack fits into other changes.\n\nWASM\nThe community is already working on improving the EVM and making the transition\nto WASM [3], which is mentioned in the video.\n\nSolidity, as a major programming language in the ecosystem, in part “competes”\nwith Python. On the other hand, enabling the Python developer community to write\nEthereum compatible smart contracts is a huge win for our community. This is why\nI want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other\nlanguage developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is,\nit’s not duplication, it’s forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for\nother language compatibility as well).\n\nMobile as a Programming Environment\nPersonally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for\nEthereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the\nsame “make Ethereum programming work from your phone” opportunity and threat\nhighlighted by Russell.\n\nSince Ethereum chains run continuously as a global “backend” — I see this as an\nopportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written\n& deployed from mobile devices today — with Ethereum blockchains providing a\nshared backend. This is connected to the “hostless” theme that we are following\nat FISSION.\n\nWhat should we work on?\nThe entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open\nsource, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.\n\nHere are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum\ncommunity can work on:\n\n 1. Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code\n    collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments\n    and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.\n 2. Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of\n    the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.\n\nFISSION’s mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider\ndevelopment community by solving real problems today & exploring fundamental\nshifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans.
