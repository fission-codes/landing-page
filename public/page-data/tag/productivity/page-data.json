Turns out quite a bit.

Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and\npublished more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.\n\nThis is Niklas LuhmannNiklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive\nbadass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking\nmethod he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words,\nZettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means\nslip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is\nabout creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.\n\nHow Zettelkasten works\nTo use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:\n\n * A way to take notes\n * A system with bidirectional linking\n * A collection of tags\n\nThat’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.\n\nA note-taking system\nLuhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a\ntypewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very\nquickly--he used the hunt and peck method.\n\nIn fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of\nfurniture--sort of like a card catalog.\n\nNot Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea\n\nWhile Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of\npaper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital\nnote-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep\noffer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices.\nTiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power,\nwhich is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.\n\nA system with bidirectional linking\nSo what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability\nto connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One\npopular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam\nResearch; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free,\nopen-source program.\n\nA collection of tags\nThe last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for\nyour thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts\nor online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps,\nopen-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing\nyour ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a\nnote-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you\ncan easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.\n\nUsing TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten\nThe great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to\nuse the Zettelkasten system.\n\n 1. A note-taking method.\n 2. Bidirectional linking\n 3. A system of Tags\n\nTiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries\ncalled “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open\nsource, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:\n\n\n\nLet’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this\none, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our\nTiddlers come up in the search results:\n\n\n\nTiddlyWiki and Fission\nAs you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your\nnotes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a\nversion of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web\nnative option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the\nbenefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and\nbidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your\nZettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and\nprotected.\n\nWe are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the \nTiddlyWiki\ngroup on the Fission forum [https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  to\nkeep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for\nFission later this spring!\n\nAlso, check out the Fission Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277], where we\nare having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects\nand all things open source.
