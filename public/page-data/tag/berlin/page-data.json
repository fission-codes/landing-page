This was the first time our team had all met in person, and we had just a\ncouple of days to wrap up code and documentation for Fission Live. Here's our\nrecap of the experience, from shipping to funding, and all stops in between.\n\nMaking friends with Poutine\nWe started things off on Friday night with our second meetup (we held the first\none as part of Berlin Blockchain Week) at Poutine Kitchen\n[http://thepoutinekitchen.de/]. \n\n> I can’t believe the #SoggyFries\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoggyFries?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]  shade.\nLook at the beauty of a “Berlin” style Poutine: a Curry Wurst on top \npic.twitter.com/nzU6ZFIEKq [https://t.co/nzU6ZFIEKq]\n\n— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) October 18, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1185235897803067396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nAnd then the majority of the team headed back* to keep coding and documenting so\nthings would be all set and as easy as possible for our hackathon users (yay\nshipping!).\n\nThanks everyone for joining us, and for experiencing the \"Canadian Kiss\" and\nother secret Canadian rituals. Stay tuned for further Poutine in Berlin\nadventures.\n\n*But, it did mean that Boris came back with the most excellent prize: 4L of\nmaple syrup! \n\nGetting started with Fission Live Workshop\nOn Saturday, Ben and Brooke walked the audience through getting started with\nFission Live.\n\nBen had worked all night to even have the slides for the presentation\n[https://slides.runfission.com]  hosted on Fission. Daniel was all up in our DNS\ntweaking so that subdomains would \"just work\", and Brooke's fingers were\nspitting out Haskell types in all directions.\n\nDiffusion had three presentation areas right next to each other. Thanks to\nwireless headsets for the presenter audio, it meant the audience could be calm\nand focused while watching the presentation. We really enjoyed this experience,\ndefinitely recommended.\n\nIPFS Help Desk\nHugo and Daniel talking IPNS over DNS and other IPFS protocol intricacies.\nDaniel had just finished hacking together our DNS automation the night before,\nso looking forward to see if we can improve this in the base protocol.It was\ngreat to be able to spend time with Hugo [https://twitter.com/hugomrdias]  and \nVasco [https://twitter.com/vascosantos10]  from Moxy Studio\n[https://moxy.studio/]  who hacked on IPFS and libp2p while hanging out on the\n2nd floor help desk space where we set up camp.\n\nWe shared what we were working on with Fission, and learned a ton about where\nIPFS is heading at the protocol layer, while sharing what we needed to make our\nservices work better. Need someone to run an IPFS help desk at your next hack\nevent? Get in touch! \n\nShipping Live\nWe got a ton done by using Diffusion as a target date to get Fission Live up and\nrunning for the hackathon participants to use.\n\nHere's a quick gif of registering, and then going live, all with our fission\ncommand line tool:\n\nIt was great to see Fission Live get picked up and used by teams throughout\nDiffusion. We learned lots – like how Infura is used as an anonymous gateway\nbecause of how hard it is to store API keys in various automated scenarios, or\nthat if we want our gateway to support hosting SPAs, we'll need to include an\nSPA mode to redirect queries to route.\n\nSee our one page Diffusion on-boarding for Fission Live\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/diffusion-onboarding-for-fission-live-get-your-apps-live-from-your-laptop/295] \n to get started with our Fission CLI tool. Our guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes]  is where we'll be improving our documentation and\ngetting started.\n\nAnd since we shipped it, we've been using it for every day use cases ourselves.\nHere's a link to some of the photos from Fission's trip to Berlin\n[https://fissionberlin.fission.name/]. Available as a regular Web2 domain name,\nbut stored on IPFS, and re-usable anywhere.\n\nBen, who joined the team just 2 weeks before the event, took his hack time over\nthe weekend and shipped a vscode extension\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode]  – teleport files onto IPFS\nand with a domain name directly from your code editor!\n\nOpen Source Licensing Evolution Talk\nBoris presented on Sunday afternoon. He's been talking about the history and\nevolution of open source, with a special focus on the legal innovation around\nlicensing. Check out the video & link to slides in our other post\n[https://blog.fission.codes/open-source-licensing-evolution-at-diffusion-2019/]\n\nMaple Syrup is for Winners\nThe top winner of the Diffusion hackathon was Decentralify (see Devpost entry\n[https://devpost.com/software/decentralify]) , built by Marco\n[https://twitter.com/mediaquery]  and Eugene [https://twitter.com/toxzique].\nThey used the Netlify Docker image, ran it on iExec, and then deployed the build\noutput to Fission.\n\nBuilding an \"open\" Netlify is part of the vision we have for Fission, so seeing\nit get built as a hackathon project, a day after we shipped the functionality,\nwas amazing.\n\nAnd here's how Marco feels about his Fission prize:\n\n> Actually, forget about the other prizes. This is where it's at: A frickin 4\nliters jug of Maple Syrup, courtesy of the crazy Canadians at @FISSIONcodes\n[https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]!

Lots of discussion about the adoption and commercialization\nof blockchain and other decentralized protocols. While we champion the developer\nend user as bottom up adoption, it was great to learn more about the needs of\nenterprise and specific industries – who in turn are eager to have better tools\nfor their developers to build on. We look forward to further collaboration with\nthe Alliance.\n\nFunding Secured\nWe announced our pre-seed funding\n[https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6591295410416029696]!\nWe're a Canadian company building out a distributed team, and we wanted to have\nglobal partners to connect us to the world, and having Outlier Ventures as a\nlead is a great fit for us.

Here's our recap of the experience, from shipping to funding, and all stops in between.</p><h2 id=\"making-friends-with-poutine\">Making friends with Poutine</h2><p>We started things off on Friday night with our second meetup (we held the first one as part of Berlin Blockchain Week) at <a href=\"http://thepoutinekitchen.de/\">Poutine Kitchen</a>. </p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I can’t believe the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoggyFries?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SoggyFries</a> shade.

Daniel was all up in our DNS tweaking so that subdomains would \"just work\", and Brooke's fingers were spitting out Haskell types in all directions.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/11/IMG_7574.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Diffusion had three presentation areas right next to each other.

Get in touch! </p><h2 id=\"shipping-live\">Shipping Live</h2><p>We got a ton done by using Diffusion as a target date to get Fission Live up and running for the hackathon participants to use.</p><p>Here's a quick gif of registering, and then going live, all with our fission command line tool:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/11/going-live-code-diffusion.gif\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>It was great to see Fission Live get picked up and used by teams throughout Diffusion. We learned lots – like how Infura is used as an anonymous gateway because of how hard it is to store API keys in various automated scenarios, or that if we want our gateway to support hosting SPAs, we'll need to include an SPA mode to redirect queries to route.</p><p>See our one page <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/t/diffusion-onboarding-for-fission-live-get-your-apps-live-from-your-laptop/295\">Diffusion on-boarding for Fission Live</a> to get started with our Fission CLI tool. Our <a href=\"https://guide.fission.codes\">guide</a> is where we'll be improving our documentation and getting started.</p><p>And since we shipped it, we've been using it for every day use cases ourselves. Here's a link to some of the <a href=\"https://fissionberlin.fission.name/\">photos from Fission's trip to Berlin</a>. Available as a regular Web2 domain name, but stored on IPFS, and re-usable anywhere.</p><p>Ben, who joined the team just 2 weeks before the event, took his hack time over the weekend and shipped a <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode\">vscode extension</a> – teleport files onto IPFS and with a domain name directly from your code editor!</p><h2 id=\"open-source-licensing-evolution-talk\">Open Source Licensing Evolution Talk</h2><p>Boris presented on Sunday afternoon. He's been talking about the history and evolution of open source, with a special focus on the legal innovation around licensing. <a href=\"https://blog.fission.codes/open-source-licensing-evolution-at-diffusion-2019/\">Check out the video &amp; link to slides in our other post</a></p><h2 id=\"maple-syrup-is-for-winners\">Maple Syrup is for Winners</h2><p>The top winner of the Diffusion hackathon was Decentralify (see <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/decentralify\">Devpost entry</a>) , built by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mediaquery\">Marco</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/toxzique\">Eugene</a>. They used the Netlify Docker image, ran it on iExec, and then deployed the build output to Fission.</p><p>Building an \"open\" Netlify is part of the vision we have for Fission, so seeing it get built as a hackathon project, a day after we shipped the functionality, was amazing.</p><p>And here's how Marco feels about his Fission prize:</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Actually, forget about the other prizes.

Lots of discussion about the adoption and commercialization of blockchain and other decentralized protocols. While we champion the developer end user as bottom up adoption, it was great to learn more about the needs of enterprise and specific industries – who in turn are eager to have better tools for their developers to build on. We look forward to further collaboration with the Alliance.</p><h2 id=\"funding-secured\">Funding Secured</h2><p>We <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6591295410416029696\">announced our pre-seed funding</a>!
