Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system\nknown as \"Zettlekasten,\" and how you can use Fission and TiddlyWiki\n[https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/]to create your own\nversion. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and\npublished more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.\n\nThis is Niklas LuhmannNiklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive\nbadass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking\nmethod he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words,\nZettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means\nslip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is\nabout creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.\n\nHow Zettelkasten works\nTo use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:\n\n * A way to take notes\n * A system with bidirectional linking\n * A collection of tags\n\nThat’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.\n\nA note-taking system\nLuhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a\ntypewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very\nquickly--he used the hunt and peck method.\n\nIn fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of\nfurniture--sort of like a card catalog.\n\nNot Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea\n\nWhile Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of\npaper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital\nnote-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep\noffer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices.\nTiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power,\nwhich is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.\n\nA system with bidirectional linking\nSo what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability\nto connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One\npopular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam\nResearch; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free,\nopen-source program.\n\nA collection of tags\nThe last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for\nyour thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts\nor online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps,\nopen-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing\nyour ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a\nnote-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you\ncan easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.\n\nUsing TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten\nThe great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to\nuse the Zettelkasten system.\n\n 1. A note-taking method.\n 2. Bidirectional linking\n 3. A system of Tags\n\nTiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries\ncalled “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open\nsource, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:\n\n\n\nLet’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this\none, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our\nTiddlers come up in the search results:\n\n\n\nTiddlyWiki and Fission\nAs you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your\nnotes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a\nversion of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web\nnative option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the\nbenefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and\nbidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your\nZettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and\nprotected.\n\nWe are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the \nTiddlyWiki\ngroup on the Fission forum [https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  to\nkeep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for\nFission later this spring!\n\nAlso, check out the Fission Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277], where we\nare having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects\nand all things open source.

Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost?\nFor small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair\nto say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with\nsocial media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what\nis the hidden cost to you? \n\nIf you have seen The Social Dilemma [https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/]  then\nyou might be familiar with this quote:\n“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel\nHövermann\n\nThe hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from\ncollecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your\nclicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases\nis your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.\n\nHere’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported\nproducts, ads are presented to you.  These advertisements are curated based on\ncookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit\nwithin the app itself.\n\nLet’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a\n“post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an\nimpression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming\ninto your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment\nfor your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar\ngiven what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant\nin our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7\nout of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first\nglance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and\nmonitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those\nwho work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.\n\nUsing ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are\ncollecting information about you. This information is collected via your\nbehaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to\ninfer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to\nwhere you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available\nsimply from behaviours you exhibit online. \n\nAt Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very\nreason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal\nrates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. \n\nWhat happens when you pay for your app:\n\n 1. Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical\n    and humane technological future.\n 2. Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.\n 3. Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application\n    you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal\n    information for targeted advertisements.\n 4. Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers\n    outside of North America and Western Europe.\n    a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of \t\t\n       500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a\n    \t\t    $25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an \t\t\t\t\n           independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in\n    developing \t    countries\n 5. Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers,\n    “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something,\n    the more they value it.”\n 6. Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data\n    for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.\n\nLet’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on\nthe street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high\nschool, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online\nevery day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and\ngames. Sounds insane right? \n\nThe future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to\nproliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of\nmany is to pay for the applications and software you use. \n\nAt Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and\nprivacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our\nmission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to\nbe part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving\ndevelopers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to\neasily charge for them.\n\nFor end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging\ninto Fission’s Drive app [https://drive.fission.codes]. It’s free for small\namounts of data, and you can pay for a premium account on Open Collective\n[https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive], which helps us build more apps and\ntools for developers.\n\nFor developers, check out some of the App ideas in the forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none], or start with the dev guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes]  to build an app of your own.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Social Dilemma.

The first step of many is to pay for the applications and software you use. </p><p>At Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and privacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our mission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to be part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving developers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to easily charge for them.</p><p>For end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging into <a href=\"https://drive.fission.codes\">Fission’s Drive app</a>. It’s free for small amounts of data, and you can pay for a <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive\">premium account on Open Collective</a>, which helps us build more apps and tools for developers.</p><p>For developers, check out some of the <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none\">App ideas in the forum</a>, or start with the <a href=\"https://guide.fission.codes\">dev guide</a> to build an app of your own.</p><p><u>References</u><br><br><em>The Social Dilemma. </em><strong>Jeff Orlowski</strong>.

It is particularly associated with C, being found in <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language\">The C Programming Language</a></em> (1978), and contrasted with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_case\">PascalCase</a> (a type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case\">camel case</a>). However, the convention traditionally had no specific name: the Python style guide refers to it simply as \"lower_case_with_underscores\".<br><br>Within <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">Usenet</a> the name \"snake_case\" was first seen in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)\">Ruby</a> community in 2004, used by Gavin Kistner<br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case</a></blockquote><p>This, of course, leads us to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE – all capitals, often used when defining constants. </p><p>And now, a vapourwave inspired illustration:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2020/01/F621DB83-9E43-4C37-B409-2828F22B3ECF.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We're a developer focused company, which means we have fun with developer-centric in jokes and illustration.

Local-first\nideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple\ndevices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and\nuser control of data.\nThe authors include a list of 7 benefits  that come from using local-first\nsolutions, which will resonate with the crypto community:\n\n 1. No spinners: your work at your fingertips\n 2. Your work is not trapped on one device\n 3. The network is optional\n 4. Seamless collaboration with colleagues\n 5. The Long Now — able to access and edit over extended timelines\n 6. Security and privacy by default\n 7. You retain ultimate control\n\nHere’s a demo of a sample app called Trellis\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9fdyDlhByM]  that duplicates Trello\nfunctionality onto a offline machine.
