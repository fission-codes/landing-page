Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system\nknown as \"Zettlekasten,\" and how you can use Fission and TiddlyWiki\n[https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/]to create your own\nversion. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and\npublished more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.\n\nThis is Niklas LuhmannNiklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive\nbadass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking\nmethod he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words,\nZettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means\nslip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is\nabout creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.\n\nHow Zettelkasten works\nTo use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:\n\n * A way to take notes\n * A system with bidirectional linking\n * A collection of tags\n\nThat’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.\n\nA note-taking system\nLuhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a\ntypewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very\nquickly--he used the hunt and peck method.\n\nIn fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of\nfurniture--sort of like a card catalog.\n\nNot Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea\n\nWhile Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of\npaper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital\nnote-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep\noffer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices.\nTiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power,\nwhich is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.\n\nA system with bidirectional linking\nSo what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability\nto connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One\npopular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam\nResearch; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free,\nopen-source program.\n\nA collection of tags\nThe last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for\nyour thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts\nor online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps,\nopen-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing\nyour ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a\nnote-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you\ncan easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.\n\nUsing TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten\nThe great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to\nuse the Zettelkasten system.\n\n 1. A note-taking method.\n 2. Bidirectional linking\n 3. A system of Tags\n\nTiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries\ncalled “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open\nsource, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:\n\n\n\nLet’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this\none, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our\nTiddlers come up in the search results:\n\n\n\nTiddlyWiki and Fission\nAs you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your\nnotes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a\nversion of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web\nnative option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the\nbenefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and\nbidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your\nZettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and\nprotected.\n\nWe are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the \nTiddlyWiki\ngroup on the Fission forum [https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  to\nkeep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for\nFission later this spring!\n\nAlso, check out the Fission Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277], where we\nare having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects\nand all things open source.

Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost?\nFor small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair\nto say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with\nsocial media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what\nis the hidden cost to you? \n\nIf you have seen The Social Dilemma [https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/]  then\nyou might be familiar with this quote:\n“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel\nHövermann\n\nThe hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from\ncollecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your\nclicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases\nis your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.\n\nHere’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported\nproducts, ads are presented to you.  These advertisements are curated based on\ncookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit\nwithin the app itself.\n\nLet’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a\n“post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an\nimpression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming\ninto your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment\nfor your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar\ngiven what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant\nin our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7\nout of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first\nglance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and\nmonitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those\nwho work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.\n\nUsing ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are\ncollecting information about you. This information is collected via your\nbehaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to\ninfer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to\nwhere you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available\nsimply from behaviours you exhibit online. \n\nAt Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very\nreason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal\nrates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. \n\nWhat happens when you pay for your app:\n\n 1. Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical\n    and humane technological future.\n 2. Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.\n 3. Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application\n    you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal\n    information for targeted advertisements.\n 4. Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers\n    outside of North America and Western Europe.\n    a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of \t\t\n       500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a\n    \t\t    $25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an \t\t\t\t\n           independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in\n    developing \t    countries\n 5. Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers,\n    “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something,\n    the more they value it.”\n 6. Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data\n    for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.\n\nLet’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on\nthe street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high\nschool, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online\nevery day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and\ngames. Sounds insane right? \n\nThe future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to\nproliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of\nmany is to pay for the applications and software you use. \n\nAt Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and\nprivacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our\nmission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to\nbe part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving\ndevelopers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to\neasily charge for them.\n\nFor end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging\ninto Fission’s Drive app [https://drive.fission.codes]. It’s free for small\namounts of data, and you can pay for a premium account on Open Collective\n[https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive], which helps us build more apps and\ntools for developers.\n\nFor developers, check out some of the App ideas in the forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none], or start with the dev guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes]  to build an app of your own.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Social Dilemma.

The first step of many is to pay for the applications and software you use. </p><p>At Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and privacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our mission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to be part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving developers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to easily charge for them.</p><p>For end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging into <a href=\"https://drive.fission.codes\">Fission’s Drive app</a>.

I'm based near\nSpringfield, Missouri, smack dab in the center of the Ozarks (recently made\nfamous by the Netflix show [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5071412/], which is\nkinda like my life but with money laundering instead of unit tests). When I'm\nnot working on building tools for the decentralized web, you can catch me\nreading cool books (currently reading\n[https://www.amazon.com/Ubik-Philip-K-Dick-ebook/dp/B005LVR6ZA]), listening to\nmusic (currently listening\n[https://open.spotify.com/album/5jgnoe0auRKrLvvj4qO5VX?si=aA_8ILIYQVKwdVaRjvAexg]\n), or rock climbing (my weekend plans\n[https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105903004/horseshoe-canyon-ranch]). \n\nHere at Fission, we've been hard at working cooking up cool new experiments with\nIPFS. IPFS's content-based addressing which gives us a flat, universal namespace\nto store files and other data prompts us to think differently about how we build\nand deploy software. This leads us to build prototypes and experiments, which\nhelp us:\n\n• Ideate projects that either we or another team can expand upon\n• Test and calibrate the tools we build for real world hands-on usage\n• Prompt the creation of new libraries/technologies\n\nOur most recent application came from a simple question that we asked: if my\npreferences are generally the same across apps, why do I need to fill out that\nsame information in every app?\n\nIntroducing IPFS Portable User Settings\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/ipfs-user-settings/]  — a completely client\nside application that allows you to update your preferences over IPFS and take\nthem with you wherever you go.\n\nPlay around with the live demo\n[https://fission-suite.github.io/ipfs-user-settings/]\nBackground\nWhile the emerging decentralized web and the web of yesteryear differ in many\nways, one way to think about it is as a difference in user model. The web2.0\nuser data model is company (or platform)-centric. This involves locking your\ndata in monolithic company-owned databases, with the end result being that your\nidentity is fragmented and duplicated across a variety of corporate silos. Web3\nbrings with it a new way of conceptualizing data: a user-centric data model. In\nthis model, a user owns their data and that data can only be read/edited by them\nand trusted people and apps. Apps take on a different function: they exist as\n\"windows\" that a user grants permissions to view or make edits to certain\nattributes of their data.\n\nOften, the benefits of web3 technology are put in reactionary terms. That is,\nit's reacting to the overreaches/missteps of the current corporate stewards of\nthe internet: censorship, sloppy or malicious use of user data, temporality\n(will I be able to see my photos on Facebook in 25 years? my archived emails on\nGmail?), and so on. \n\nOne thing that we aim to do at Fission is not only address the failings of web2,\nbut also create positive reasons to make the jump to web3.\n\nDecentralized apps should be fun and easy for developers to create, and exciting\nfor users to adopt because they offer features not possible in the old web. This\nwas our motivation when developing our Portable User Settings. We wanted to give\nthe intuition behind some of what's possible with web3 and a technical demo that\na more robust version could be based on.\n\nWe also wanted to make this app completely p2p. No HTTP gateways required here!\nIf your browser is IPFS-enabled and you're running a local daemon, the app\nconnects to that daemon. If not, it gracefully sets up an in-browser instance of\n js-ipfs [https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs].\n\nThere are lots of directions this could go. Maybe we want to enable universal\ndark mode so that all the websites you browse respect your global dark mode\nsetting? Leave a comment on what portable user setting you'd like to see in the\nworld.\n\nTechnical Results\nThis project yielded not only a pretty neat demo, but also some useful technical\noffshoots:\n\nget-ipfs [https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs]\nOne of the biggest issues that developers can face when trying to make use of\nthe decentralized web is the high barrier to entry. We wrapped our IPFS fallback\nfunctionality into it's own package: get-ipfs\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs]. This is your new one-stop shop for\nloading an IPFS instance into a webpage. It's as simple as const ipfs = await\ngetIpfs()  and you can make direct P2P use of the decentralized web in your\nwebapp. Give it a go and let us know how it works for you!\n\nFission JavaScript Client\nThis app was also our first time using the Fission JavaScript client\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client]  in the wild. While\nadding/getting is done P2P, requests to pin must be sent over HTTP. The library,\nhowever, has all the functionality you need to make IPFS-enabled apps over HTTP.\nCheck out the library [https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client]  and\nsee what cool uses you can come up with!\n\nHosted IPFS Node\nWhile we were already hosting an IPFS node, our hosted node is now much more\nrobust. It's capable of handling secure websocket connects (so it can talk to\nin-browser js-ipfs  nodes!) and stores data in S3. Check out the walkthrough we\nposted for setting up your own IPFS node on AWS\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/a-loosely-written-guide-to-hosting-an-ipfs-node-on-aws/234]\n!\n\nAgain, checkout the demo here\n[https://fission-suite.github.io/ipfs-user-settings/], or keep reading to find\nout how to build and host your own!\n\nRun/Deploy your own app\nFork the repo\nNote: This is only necessary if you are planning on deploying your own user\nsettings app. If you just want to play around locally, you can simply clone the\nrepository.\n\nClick \"Fork\" in the upper-right corner of the repository.\n\nClone the repo locally\nIn your terminal, clone the ipfs-user-settings  repo:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\ncd ipfs-user-settings\n\nSetup environment\nThe environment variables are optional, but will need to be setup for the best\nuser experience.\n\nFirst, create a .env  file in the root of the repository:\ntouch .env\n\nYour .env  will end up looking something like this:\n\nREACT_APP_DEFAULT_CID = QmUWWqCNSdZmus7mc52um5cpqUi1CaE97AzBTY7iWfBXV9\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE = /dns4/ipfs.runfission.com/tcp/4003/wss/ipfs/QmVLEz2SxoNiFnuyLpbXsH6SvjPTrHNMU88vCQZyhgBzgw\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_URL = https://runfission.com\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_USERNAME = ADD_USERNAME_HERE\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_PASSWORD = ADD_PASSWORD_HERE\n\n\nLet's walk through what each of those variables will do.\n\nREACT_APP_DEFAULT_CID: the cid that contains the default settings that you want\na new user to see. You can set it to the above value for our recommended\ndefaults (or leave it blank and it will default to that).\n\n**Edited this section to reflect recent changes**\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_TCP: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like\nthe user's node to connect to through tcp (for instance with a local daemon\nthrough ipfs companion [https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion]). You\ncan set it to the above value to connect to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or\nleave it blank and it will default to that).\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_WSS: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like\nthe user's node to connect to through wss (if the user does not have an\nipfs-enabled browser and falls back to an in-browser js-ipfs daemon). You can\nset it to the above value to connect  to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or\nleave it blank and it will  default to that). \nNote:  if you use a custom node, it must be interoperable with js-ipfs. This\nmeans that it either needs to connect via WebRTC or Secured Websockets (notice\nthe wss  in the above multiaddr).\n\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_...: the last three variables are your\nprovisioned account information for using the Fission web-api. These are used\nfor pinning content to the Fission IPFS node so that content will stay online\neven after a user goes offline. If you leave them blank, the webapp will not pin\nuser content. At the moment, these can be obtained by joining the Fission\nHeroku\nadd-on alpha [https://elements.heroku.com/addons/interplanetary-fission]. If\nyou've tried out our earlier photo gallery demo\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/ipfs-photo-gallery], you can use the same\ncredentials here, otherwise follow that tutorial\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/ipfs-photo-gallery-in-alpha-mode/197/10]  to\nprovision a username and password\n\nRun the app locally\nFirst install dependencies:\nnpm install\n\nThen run the app:\nnpm run start\n\nThis will open up a page in your browser at http://localhost:3000!\n\nPlay around a bit! Try changing your settings, saving it, and loading past CIDs.\n\nBuild app\nIn order for your app to build with the correct internal links, you'll need to\nchange the homepage:\nOpen package.json  and change the homepage  to the url where this site will be\nhosted ($YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ipfs-user-settings).\n\nBuild the app:\nnpm run build\n\n\nDeploy app\nDeploy with your favorite tool: Heroku, GitHub pages, etc. Or if you're reading\nthis a month from now, use the new \"Fission Live\" tool 😉\n\nWe've included a deployment command for GitHub pages.\n\nFirst, make sure that your repository is set as the git remote.\nThis won't work if it's still set to fission-suite.\n\nRun: git remote -v  and ensure that that the url next to remote is \nhttps://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\n\nIf you forked the repo earlier, this should be fine. If you do need to change\nyour remote, just run\ngit remote set origin https://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\n\nDeploy the app:\nnpm run deploy\n\nNow open your browser to $YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ipfs-user-settings  to see\nyour site up and running!\n\nLet us know how it goes!

IPFS's content-based addressing which gives us a flat, universal namespace to store files and other data prompts us to think differently about how we build and deploy software.

The web2.0 user data model is company (or platform)-centric. This involves locking your data in monolithic company-owned databases, with the end result being that your identity is fragmented and duplicated across a variety of corporate silos. Web3 brings with it a new way of conceptualizing data: a user-centric data model. In this model, a user owns their data and that data can only be read/edited by them and trusted people and apps. Apps take on a different function: they exist as \"windows\" that a user grants permissions to view or make edits to certain attributes of their data.<br><br>Often, the benefits of web3 technology are put in reactionary terms. That is, it's reacting to the overreaches/missteps of the current corporate stewards of the internet: censorship, sloppy or malicious use of user data, temporality (will I be able to see my photos on Facebook in 25 years? my archived emails on Gmail?), and so on. <br><br>One thing that we aim to do at Fission is not only address the failings of web2, but also create positive reasons to make the jump to web3.</p><p>Decentralized apps should be fun and easy for developers to create, and exciting for users to adopt because they offer features not possible in the old web. This was our motivation when developing our Portable User Settings. We wanted to give the intuition behind some of what's possible with web3 and a technical demo that a more robust version could be based on.<br><br>We also wanted to make this app completely p2p. No HTTP gateways required here! If your browser is IPFS-enabled and you're running a local daemon, the app connects to that daemon. If not, it gracefully sets up an in-browser instance of <a href=\"https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs\"><code>js-ipfs</code></a>.</p><p>There are lots of directions this could go. Maybe we want to enable universal dark mode so that all the websites you browse respect your global dark mode setting? Leave a comment on what portable user setting you'd like to see in the world.</p><h2 id=\"technical-results\">Technical Results</h2><p>This project yielded not only a pretty neat demo, but also some useful technical offshoots:<br><br><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs\">get-ipfs</a></strong><br>One of the biggest issues that developers can face when trying to make use of the decentralized web is the high barrier to entry. We wrapped our IPFS fallback functionality into it's own package: <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs\">get-ipfs</a>. This is your new one-stop shop for loading an IPFS instance into a webpage. It's as simple as <code>const ipfs = await getIpfs()</code> and you can make direct P2P use of the decentralized web in your webapp. Give it a go and let us know how it works for you!<br><br><strong>Fission JavaScript Client</strong><br>This app was also our first time using the <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client\">Fission JavaScript client</a> in the wild. While adding/getting is done P2P, requests to pin must be sent over HTTP. The library, however, has all the functionality you need to make IPFS-enabled apps over HTTP. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client\">library</a> and see what cool uses you can come up with!<br><br><strong>Hosted IPFS Node</strong><br>While we were already hosting an IPFS node, our hosted node is now much more robust. It's capable of handling secure websocket connects (so it can talk to in-browser <code>js-ipfs</code> nodes!) and stores data in S3.

You can set it to the above value for our recommended defaults (or leave it blank and it will default to that).</p><p><em>**<em>Edited this section to reflect recent changes</em>**</em><br><code>REACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_TCP</code>: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like the user's node to connect to through tcp (for instance with a local daemon through <a href=\"https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion\">ipfs companion</a>). You can set it to the above value to connect to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or leave it blank and it will default to that).<br><code>REACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_WSS</code>: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like the user's node to connect to through wss (if the user does not have an ipfs-enabled browser and falls back to an in-browser js-ipfs daemon). You can set it to the above value to connect  to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or leave it blank and it will  default to that). <br><strong>Note:</strong> if you use a custom node, it must be interoperable with <code>js-ipfs</code>. This means that it either needs to connect via WebRTC or Secured Websockets (notice the <code>wss</code> in the above multiaddr).</p><p><code>REACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_...</code>: the last three variables are your provisioned account information for using the Fission web-api. These are used for pinning content to the Fission IPFS node so that content will stay online even after a user goes offline. If you leave them blank, the webapp will not pin user content.
