Drupal is\n19 years old this year!I went on to host Dries in Vancouver [https://dri.es/album/vancouver-2004/]  in\n2004, along with the first printed Drupal t-shirts, a beer tower\n[https://dri.es/album/vancouver-2004/pub-beer-tower-2], and the folks from\nDeanSpace / CivicSpace (working on the Democratic primaries) flew up to join us.\n\nAllow me some brief nostalgia…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI founded Bryght\n[https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2004-08-30/who-are-these-bryght-guys]\n, one of the first commercial companies focused on Drupal, helped organize many\nmore DrupalCons and DrupalCamps, and helped found the Drupal Association.\n\nFOSDEM 2005, before which the first DrupalCon had about 40 peopleWe were in the\nthick of Web 1.0 transitioning to Web 2.0, and the early days of identity\nstandards and communication between websites. That post I made about the \nrecipe.module  is actually tied to a Blogger.com account, which at the time you\ncould use to login to drupal.org.\n\nOpen source licenses and the details of GPL were hotly contested, and we faced a\nlot of FUD from Microsoft and others. A global community using mailing lists and\nIRC was forming, and we didn't know what we were doing was new and different,\nbut that we had come for the code and were staying for the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I see Web3 emerging – although the blog post where I attempt to define what\nthat means to me still isn't finished yet!\n\nNew open source licenses are emerging (Dries on Makers and Takers\n[https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source]),\nbusiness models beyond the advertising supported web are being sought for.\n\nAdvances in computer science theory have given us new tools for distributed\nsystems and cryptography, leading to both better privacy and programmable\nInternet money. \n\nDries' post on low-code and no code tools\n[https://dri.es/low-code-and-no-code-tools-continue-to-drive-the-web-forward] \nshows more changes that I think fit into this theme:\n\n> When everyone is a builder, more good things will happen on the web. I was\nexcited about this trend more than 12 years ago, and remain excited today. I'm\neager to see the progress no-code and low-code solutions will bring to the web\nin the next decade.\nThe Drupal community has long been eager to experiment with new technology and\nstandards. How will Drupal's traditional LAMP stack architecture fit with\nserverless and decentralized approaches? What new standards and protocols make\nsense to integrate and expand on?\n\nWhat new experiences do they enable that offer benefits for everyone from site\nbuilders to Drupal end users?\n\nPlease join me in Minneapolis for my presentation Drupal and the Decentralized\nWeb\n[https://events.drupal.org/minneapolis2020/sessions/drupal-and-decentralized-web]\n.

I'll be presenting about Drupal and the Decentralized Web, and some of the changes that have happened from the past to the present on a number of topics, including open source licenses, a shift in architectures and hosting, the rise of the advertising supported web, and what a more peer-to-peer future holds.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> DrupalCon Global has been rescheduled as a fully online, distributed conference.
