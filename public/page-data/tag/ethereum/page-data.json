Given the ever\npresent challenges related to privacy, database breaches and platform lock-in,\nit's crucial to begin returning data autonomy back to users. \n\nThis post highlights an ETHNewYork [https://ethnewyork.com/]  submission from \nKian Molani [https://twitter.com/KianMolani]  called Y3\n[https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx]: \"a decentralized and\ncensorship-resistant video streaming application that uses Ethereum and IPFS as\nits core technologies.\" ETHNewYork was the first hackathon run in NYC by\nETHglobal, an organisation dedicated to onboarding new Ethereum developers.\nFirst we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION\nasked the team about their background and hackathon experience.\n\nHackathon Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx\n\nRepo: https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Y3 works\nThe name originated as an aspirational take on where video platforms might head\nin our distributed future. If Youtube (Y2) is a legacy system that can censor\nusers and withhold payments for content, Y3 is an exploration towards a future\nwhere new possibilities open up. Self-hosted, replicated content can't be taken\ndown, and payments over Ethereum are censorship resistant to a high degree.\n\nThe first step for users is to be running or have access to an IPFS node. After\nloading their content into the IPFS interface [https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs],\nusers submit a content hash to the Y3 onchain Ethereum contract. The video\nmetadata gets stored in a contract array to be accessed later by users.\n\nPayment, if required, would be handled via a Python script, conditional upon\nsuccessful delivery of content from the IPFS network. The contract would then\ncall a function that sets up the transaction. This is one thing that still needs\nto be developed for the project to operate properly. According to Kian,  this\nkind of payment scheme wouldn't be practical in reality: \n\n> Instead, an implementation of either state channels or probabilistic\nmicropayments –with the total time of video content already streamed taken to be\nthe primary metric for payment – would be more apt.\nHLS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming]  (HTTP Live Streaming)\nand IPNS [https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/]  (InterPlanetary Naming\nSystem) integrations are also still under development. For now, Y3 can only\nserve static content. IPNS would make those links mutable, and would update the\ncontent address as new chunks of data come in.\n\nOther important libraries used are web3.JS\n[https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/], Infura's API\n[https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/makeRequests.md]  for Ethereum\nintegration, and FFmpeg [https://ffmpeg.org/]  for HLS capable video editing.\n\nIn the future, Kian would like to add a more intuitive frontend. The FISSION\nteam is looking forward to seeing where the project ends up and what functions\nhe can integrate!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here are a few additional questions we had Kian answer about his\nbackground and the hackathon itself:\n\nWhat’s your background as a developer?\n\nI’m currently 21, and so I’m still pursuing my undergrad. As an Engineering\nPhysics major, I’m not left with a lot of time during the semester to develop\nEthereum-related projects, but do develop data processing and machine learning\nsoftware professionally. When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the\ndecentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I’ve been to two ETHGlobal\nevents, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech — a\ndecentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation\napplication.\n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?\n\nI along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of\nmouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies.\nOut of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my\ncolleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these\npopular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for\nourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical\nand worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a\nheightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and\ncutting-edge developments in the space.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nFor tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is\na very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very\nactive on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the\nresult is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel\nconcepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you’re forced to\njudge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out,\nwhile the upside is that you’re exposed to ideas soon after they’re born.\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nOne of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of\nsponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful\nand exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers\npresent, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.\n\nWhat inspired Y3?\n\nA video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized\ntechnologies where the benefits are very obvious to see – you don’t have go\nthrough leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a\nplatform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that\nwe’ve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all\nkinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly\nengaging. This luxury, however, isn’t afforded to the billions of people around\nthe world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency.\nThus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the\npursuit of its realization is noble.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS?\n\nIPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store\nthe contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution,\nit was fairly elegant – the only major disadvantage being the lack of\npersistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being\naddressed by developers of the protocol.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nConnecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate\nPython client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest\nchallenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for\nHLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate\nof incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network\nconnectivity).\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nAfter expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly\nintegrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from\nLivepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their\nprojects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to\nIPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents\nperiodically.\n\nAny plans to keep working on the project?\n\nYes. My application does not completely function as intended.

Given the ever present challenges related to privacy, database breaches and platform lock-in, it's crucial to begin returning data autonomy back to users. </p><p>This post highlights an <a href=\"https://ethnewyork.com/\">ETHNewYork</a> submission from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KianMolani\">Kian Molani</a> called <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx\">Y3</a>: \"a decentralized and censorship-resistant video streaming application that uses Ethereum and IPFS as its core technologies.\" ETHNewYork was the first hackathon run in NYC by ETHglobal, an organisation dedicated to onboarding new Ethereum developers. First we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION asked the team about their background and hackathon experience.</p><p>Hackathon Devpost: <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx\">https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx</a></p><p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app\">https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h3 id=\"how-y3-works\">How Y3 works</h3><p>The name originated as an aspirational take on where video platforms might head in our distributed future. If Youtube (Y2) is a legacy system that can censor users and withhold payments for content, Y3 is an exploration towards a future where new possibilities open up. Self-hosted, replicated content can't be taken down, and payments over Ethereum are censorship resistant to a high degree.</p><p>The first step for users is to be running or have access to an IPFS node. After loading their content into the <a href=\"https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs\">IPFS interface</a>, users submit a content hash to the Y3 onchain Ethereum contract. The video metadata gets stored in a contract array to be accessed later by users.</p><p>Payment, if required, would be handled via a Python script, conditional upon successful delivery of content from the IPFS network. The contract would then call a function that sets up the transaction. This is one thing that still needs to be developed for the project to operate properly. According to Kian,  this kind of payment scheme wouldn't be practical in reality: </p><blockquote>Instead, an implementation of either state channels or probabilistic micropayments –with the total time of video content already streamed taken to be the primary metric for payment – would be more apt.</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming\">HLS</a> (HTTP Live Streaming) and <a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/\">IPNS</a> (InterPlanetary Naming System) integrations are also still under development. For now, Y3 can only serve static content. IPNS would make those links mutable, and would update the content address as new chunks of data come in.</p><p>Other important libraries used are <a href=\"https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/\">web3.JS</a>, <a href=\"https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/makeRequests.md\">Infura's API</a> for Ethereum integration, and <a href=\"https://ffmpeg.org/\">FFmpeg</a> for HLS capable video editing.</p><p>In the future, Kian would like to add a more intuitive frontend. The FISSION team is looking forward to seeing where the project ends up and what functions he can integrate!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-19.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Finally, here are a few additional questions we had Kian answer about his background and the hackathon itself:</p><p><strong>What’s your background as a developer?</strong></p><p>I’m currently 21, and so I’m still pursuing my undergrad. As an Engineering Physics major, I’m not left with a lot of time during the semester to develop Ethereum-related projects, but do develop data processing and machine learning software professionally. When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the decentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I’ve been to two ETHGlobal events, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech — a decentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation application.</p><p><strong>What got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?</strong></p><p>I along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of mouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies. Out of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my colleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these popular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for ourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical and worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a heightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and cutting-edge developments in the space.</p><p><strong>Where do you go to read tech news / developer news?</strong></p><p>For tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is a very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very active on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the result is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel concepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you’re forced to judge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out, while the upside is that you’re exposed to ideas soon after they’re born.</p><p><strong>In general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?</strong></p><p>One of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of sponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful and exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers present, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.</p><p><strong>What inspired Y3?</strong></p><p>A video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized technologies where the benefits are very obvious to see – you don’t have go through leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a platform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that we’ve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all kinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly engaging. This luxury, however, isn’t afforded to the billions of people around the world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency. Thus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the pursuit of its realization is noble.</p><p><strong>What made you want to integrate IPFS?</strong></p><p>IPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store the contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution, it was fairly elegant – the only major disadvantage being the lack of persistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being addressed by developers of the protocol.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?</strong></p><p>Connecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate Python client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest challenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for HLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate of incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network connectivity).</p><p><strong>What was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon participants?</strong></p><p>After expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly integrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from Livepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their projects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to IPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents periodically.</p><p><strong>Any plans to keep working on the project?</strong></p><p>Yes. My application does not completely function as intended. I will finish properly implementing HLS functionality and then go on to share the project online.</p><p><strong>In hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the project or the hackathon?</strong></p><p>I actually anticipated the issue that I had regarding the implementation of HLS functionality with IPFS before I even started the project. In hindsight, I should have sought out a solution to my problem well before I ever encountered it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><br>Thanks Kian for spending time to help get this post ready for others to learn from.

By\ndeploying to the public Ethereum chain, creating open source proxy servers and\nutilising a distributed storage layer like IPFS, much of that risk is avoided. \n\nBefore using 0xSU, users need to make sure they have either a traditional\nweb-browser like Chrome plus wallet extension (ie Metamask\n[https://metamask.io/]) or through a Web3 browser like Status\n[https://status.im/]  or Coinbase Wallet [https://wallet.coinbase.com/]. If\nthat's ready, they can navigate to 0xSU.co [https://0xsu.co/]  with the URL they\nwant to shorten and store immutably. The web3 frontend is hosted through IPFS,\nmeaning everything needed to make this work properly already exists outside of a\ncentralised server. Currently, the node is hosted through Digital Ocean.\n\nOnce on the site, users submit the link along with a small amount of Ether to\ncover associated gas costs. Under the hood, the link is written into the\ncontract (address on Etherscan\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x19624ffa41fe26744e74fdbba77bef967a222d4c]) as a\nkey value pair: the full link and the shortened one. The backend sits onchain in\nthe contract, accessed via either a helper js library\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-js-lib]  or one of the open source 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  proxy servers: flask\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-flask-server], sinatra\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-sinatra-server], or express\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-express-server].\n\nAdditionally, the url shortener doesn't work without an http redirect, so they\nwrote open source forwarding proxies that enable this and anyone can run. The\nproject currently uses Quiknode [https://quiknode.io/]  as the Web3 provider to\nsupply a node that the forwarders can hook into.\n\nGiven that the code is open source, anyone could fork the front end and run\ntheir own forwarding instance. In the future, users could get served ads to\noffset the cost of forwarding. Alternatively, the team is also looking at\nintegrating the Gas Station Network\n[https://medium.com/groundhog-network/the-gas-station-network-alliance-6fd543e7eca3]\n, a collaboration between Ethereum organisations that cover the cost of gas for\nonboarding new users and subsidised apps.\n\nIn the future, the project will have to consider the implications of state rent\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arw0au/what_is_state_rent_in_ethereum_and_how_does_it/]\n. Users, or the Gas Station Network might have to provide an additional payment\nto wake a dormant contract back into state. A partial workaround for this could\nbe to cache the high traffic URLs in something like Heroku. \n\nFuture UI improvements might include adding a Wyre [https://www.sendwyre.com/] \nintegration to allow users to use credit cards instead of maintaining a\ncompatible wallet. The team hopes to continue working on it as a side project.\n\nHere's a quick video demo of 0xSU in action:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here's a set of questions we had the team answer:\n\nWhat is your developer background?\n\nJon: I graduated from a full-stack coding bootcamp about a month ago. Before\nthat I just dabbled a little with JavaScript.\n\nAuston: I am a self-taught developer who started writing code about 12 years\nago. I am always interested in learning new languages & Solidity / Ethereum are\nsuper powerful conceptually. \n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralisation initially? \n\nJon: I found the idea of the blockchain and its serverless application\nfascinating. I wanted to learn more and my research told me the Ethereum network\nis the best run place to start.\n\nAuston: For me it started in 2011 when my friend Michael had a little hacker\nmeetup & decided to talk about bitcoin. I dismissed it initially but eventually\ncame around to the idea. Finally my friend Kai reached out in 2017 & told me\nabout Ethereum, that’s when I really started to dive deep, as I realized there\nwas now a censorship resistant platform that could be built upon.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nJon: hackernoon, medium, techcrunch, dev.to [http://dev.to/]\n\nAuston: I love hacker news! Twitter is always fun to discover random things & on\noccasion, Hacker Noon. \n\nDo you listen to any technology or developer podcasts?\n\nJon: I would if I found the time.\n\nAuston: Shill time! I have been working on a podcast for a few weeks with my\nfriend Jose, you can go listen to it on the Devshirts' site\n[https://devshirts.co/blogs/podcasts].\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nJon: Was pretty interesting and inspiring. It was my first time and I didn’t\nknow where to begin, but luckily I teamed up with Auston who is a nice guy &\nhelped guide me.\n\nAuston: It was really invigorating to see so many people hyped up about Ethereum\n& working on Dapps. I definitely appreciated the sponsor dev support, we\nlaunched a node on quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  and got some help from\nthen sendwyre.com [http://sendwyre.com/]  team. Also was super cool to get some\nhelp from Vitalik himself debugging an issue with our smart contract. \n\nWhat inspired the project? \n\nGoo.gl [http://goo.gl/]  had been taken down which is a shame because it was a\nuseful service, and we wanted to make sure that couldn’t happen again by using\nthe blockchain.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS? \n\nAuston: IPFS is a project I’ve known about since 2017 that again I thought would\nbe a super awesome way to distribute copies of content on.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nAuston: None really, it was actually super easy for the most part. However I had\nto find a guide that showed me to how to point a domain at the IPFS node.\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nThere were other apps and apis that could make what we did cheaper and faster,\nbut we kept it simple. Also the positive attitude of the judges was really nice\nto have, they were really onboard with the fact that we deployed to main net,\netc. \n\nAny plans to keep working on the project? \n\nWould definitely love to integrate Stripe to make it possible to pay for link\nshortening with a credit/debit card, get more people running a forwarding server\n& perhaps integrate the gas station network to let people pay with BAT or by\nwatching ads.\n\nIn hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the\nproject or the hackathon?\n\nAuston: Jon would have liked to integrate more sponsors, but I’m actually really\nhappy with the outcome. \n\nAny side projects or interests you would like to shill?\n\nAuston: Definitely quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  as well as 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  - you should try both and run a forwarding server!!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks Jon & Auston for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn\nfrom. We'll be posting other IPFS projects on this blog as well >> be sure to\ncheck back soon.\n\nOur first product is an IPFS add-on for Heroku. Interested in testing it out\nwhen we launch?

Python is 28 years old, and\nthe context is — how does it stay relevant for the next 10 years? How does it\nplan to do things, to remain relevant? And what “black swan” events does Python\nneed to be prepared for?\n\nThe essential topic is, Python has been around for 28 years; how does it make\nsure it stays around for 10 more years? Covers “black swan” events, open source\ncommunity norms, WASM, volunteerism vs. funding experts, contributor burn out,\nand more.\n\nTake Aways for Ethereum\nA lot of this is familiar to be me because I have a long history with open\nsource projects. But, that’s history: one big point is that we need to be\nthinking about — and planning for! — the future of collaborative projects. From\nmy recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot\nabout the topics covered.\n\nI feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the\n“Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming\nmore traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.\n\nAlexey’s article about Eth1x\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60] \n highlights this shift well: a shift in who  works on research and\nimplementation, and a shift in how  the process is changing and needs to\ncontinue to evolve.\n\n> Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation\nteams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group\nand start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires\nfinding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But\nat least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable\nprocess.\n\n— Alexey Akhunov\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60]\nIn other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes after \ngrowth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the Ethereum Foundation\n[https://ethereum.foundation]  actively divest itself of core responsibilities.\n\nOh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years\nstill co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.\n\nIf I could, I would want to get up on stage at DevCon5 [https://devcon.org]  and\nessentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.\n\nHere are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:\n\nBecoming Open Source\nEthereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need\nto spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and\niteratively making things better.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that\nget assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.\n\nEvery day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying\ncry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er”\nmindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei\n\nI am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository\nnorms (issues & PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source\nexperience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue,\nbettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new\ncode contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.\n\nOpen Source Licensing & Funding isn’t a Solved Problem\nOpen source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning\nfrom other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead\nin experiments in these areas.\n\nOpen source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There\nis a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down\nadoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around\nopen source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate\nrevenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.\n\nFunding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say\nthat only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project\ntradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate\nopen source awareness into their thinking.\n\nEmbrace the Ethereum Stack\nI’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC\nmiddleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language,\nthe EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of\nthese are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and\ncollaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains,\nsidechains, and private enterprise contexts.\n\nThis is a strength if  we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum.\nWhile still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the\nentire stack can benefit from and link into.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and\nsupporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.\n\nWe’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog\nfor Ethereum Stack) on the RUN EVM site [https://RUNEVM.com]. And yet, I was\nstill surprised to see ThoughtWorks Radar highlight “EVM beyond Ethereum”\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link]\n; it’s in their “Trial” category, one before “Adopt” recommendation.\n\nEVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms]Ethereum’s Black Swans\nWhat disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might\naffect Ethereum? Even while thinking about distributed ledger technology and\nrelated decentralized web tech as a disruption itself, we need to look at how\nthe Ethereum stack fits into other changes.\n\nWASM\nThe community is already working on improving the EVM and making the transition\nto WASM [3], which is mentioned in the video.\n\nSolidity, as a major programming language in the ecosystem, in part “competes”\nwith Python. On the other hand, enabling the Python developer community to write\nEthereum compatible smart contracts is a huge win for our community. This is why\nI want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other\nlanguage developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is,\nit’s not duplication, it’s forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for\nother language compatibility as well).\n\nMobile as a Programming Environment\nPersonally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for\nEthereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the\nsame “make Ethereum programming work from your phone” opportunity and threat\nhighlighted by Russell.\n\nSince Ethereum chains run continuously as a global “backend” — I see this as an\nopportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written\n& deployed from mobile devices today — with Ethereum blockchains providing a\nshared backend. This is connected to the “hostless” theme that we are following\nat FISSION.\n\nWhat should we work on?\nThe entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open\nsource, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.\n\nHere are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum\ncommunity can work on:\n\n 1. Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code\n    collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments\n    and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.\n 2. Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of\n    the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.\n\nFISSION’s mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider\ndevelopment community by solving real problems today & exploring fundamental\nshifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans. I look forward\nto completing this mission alongside the growth of the Ethereum community.\n\nSign up if you want to get involved as an alpha tester »\n[https://tools.fission.codes]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Reading\nI haven’t read Elisabeth Ostrom’s 1990 book, “Governing the Commons: The\nEvolution of Institutions for Collective Action“.

From my recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot about the topics covered.</p><p>I feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the “Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming more traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.</p><p>Alexey’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60\">article about Eth1x</a> highlights this shift well: a shift in <em>who</em> works on research and implementation, and a shift in <em>how</em> the process is changing and needs to continue to evolve.</p><blockquote>Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation teams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group and start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires finding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But at least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable process.<br><br>— <a href=\"https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60\">Alexey Akhunov</a></blockquote><p>In other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes <em>after</em> growth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the <a href=\"https://ethereum.foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a> actively divest itself of core responsibilities.</p><p>Oh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years still co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.</p><p>If I could, I would want to get up on stage at <a href=\"https://devcon.org\">DevCon5</a> and essentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.</p><p>Here are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:</p><h3 id=\"becoming-open-source\">Becoming Open Source</h3><p>Ethereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need to spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and iteratively making things better.</p><p>What does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that get assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.</p><p>Every day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying cry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er” mindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei</p><p>I am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository norms (issues &amp; PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source experience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue, bettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new code contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.</p><h3 id=\"open-source-licensing-funding-isn-t-a-solved-problem\">Open Source Licensing &amp; Funding isn’t a Solved Problem</h3><p>Open source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning from other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead in experiments in these areas.</p><p>Open source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There is a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down adoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around open source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate revenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.</p><p>Funding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say that only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project tradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate open source awareness into their thinking.</p><h3 id=\"embrace-the-ethereum-stack\">Embrace the Ethereum Stack</h3><p>I’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC middleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language, the EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of these are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and collaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains, sidechains, and private enterprise contexts.</p><p>This is a strength <strong>if</strong> we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum. While still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the entire stack can benefit from and link into.</p><p>The Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and supporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.</p><p>We’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog for Ethereum Stack) on the <a href=\"https://RUNEVM.com\">RUN EVM site</a>. And yet, I was still surprised to see <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link\">ThoughtWorks Radar highlight “EVM beyond Ethereum”</a>; it’s in their “Trial” category, one before “Adopt” recommendation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/05/00DB9795-115B-4E74-98A8-AE80D84D9566.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>EVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms\">ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id=\"ethereum-s-black-swans\">Ethereum’s Black Swans</h2><p>What disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might affect Ethereum? Even while thinking about distributed ledger technology and related decentralized web tech as a disruption itself, we need to look at how the Ethereum stack fits into other changes.</p><h3 id=\"wasm\">WASM</h3><p>The community is already working on improving the EVM and making the transition to WASM [3], which is mentioned in the video.</p><p>Solidity, as a major programming language in the ecosystem, in part “competes” with Python. On the other hand, enabling the Python developer community to write Ethereum compatible smart contracts is a huge win for our community. This is why I want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other language developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is, it’s not duplication, it’s forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for other language compatibility as well).</p><h3 id=\"mobile-as-a-programming-environment\">Mobile as a Programming Environment</h3><p>Personally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for Ethereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the same “make Ethereum programming work from your phone” opportunity and threat highlighted by Russell.</p><p>Since Ethereum chains run continuously as a global “backend” — I see this as an opportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written &amp; deployed from mobile devices today — with Ethereum blockchains providing a shared backend. This is connected to the “hostless” theme that we are following at FISSION.</p><h2 id=\"what-should-we-work-on\">What should we work on?</h2><p>The entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open source, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.</p><p>Here are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum community can work on:</p><ol><li>Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.</li><li>Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.</li></ol><p>FISSION’s mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider development community by solving real problems today &amp; exploring fundamental shifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans. I look forward to completing this mission alongside the growth of the Ethereum community.</p><p><a href=\"https://tools.fission.codes\">Sign up if you want to get involved as an alpha tester »</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><h2 id=\"further-reading\">Further Reading</h2><p>I haven’t read Elisabeth Ostrom’s 1990 book, “Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action“.
