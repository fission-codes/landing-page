Can I access your files? Can I see your photos? For security reasons,\nthese same sort of permissions are making their way into modern desktop\noperating systems as well.\n\nWith a regular web app, we don't get any of that.

You're using an app that is running on someone else's server, where\nyour data is stored. At best, you've got an export function, and hopefully a\nlowest common denominator format that you can import somewhere else. \n\nWant to work with a batch of your images? First step, upload them all to a\nserver. And hope that you can get export them later. Or that the developer has\nbacked up those files in case something goes wrong. And, that the developer\nhasn't made any mistakes around security and privacy.\n\nOn our smartphones, we feel more in control. Apps ask us for permission. We can\nattach three or four different apps to our photo library, and switch between\nthem, all the while having all of our photos available to us.\n\nThat's how we've built Fission's web native apps. Each app asks for permission,\ngets its own space to write files to. Everything is encrypted, and neither\nFission nor the app developer can see your files without permission.\n\nI'll quote MacWright again:\n\n> There was a time when we could install applications, give some sort of explicit\nagreement that something would run on our computers and use our hardware. \nUsing a web native app is more like installing an app. It uses your local\nidentity, your files, and in many cases can even run offline.\n\nIt is using your browser as an operating system.\n\nWeb Native Apps with Fission\nFission is building an app hosting marketplace for developers and users that\nsupports web native apps.\n\nFor developers, they can design a user app using only front end and design\nskills. The web native app can be installed by 10 or 10,000 users, just like\nmobile or desktop software. Because the app is running on the user's computer,\nyou can focus on finding new users and adding new features, rather than having\nto learn DevOps or server scaling. It's the fastest way to start sharing – and\nsoon, selling – your app on the web.\n\nUsers create a secure identity in their browsers. Every Fission account is\nlinked to a file system, available in any browser. Much like an open source\niCloud, users give permissions to apps, and can access their files from\nanywhere. Users can browse their file system, both public and private, and mix\nand match which apps they use, just like they're used to with mobile and desktop\napps.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur code is open source [https://github.com/fission-suite].
