Yak shaving  is one of those terms. It's fun to dig into the concepts\nand learn about their background, teach other people about them, and we get some\ncool images to use in a number of different ways that aren't just company\nbranding.

The bear is holding a Club Mate drink, traditional\ndrink of German hackers (although I know at one time the Mozilla Vancouver team\nimported it for their office fridge, too!). And the penguin is the long time\nmascot of Linux.\n\nWizards and Snakes\nSince then, we've worked with Bruno Monts [https://www.behance.net/brunomonts],\nan illustrator based in Brasil, to create a number of other illustrations.\n\nWe just released the Haskell Wizards  series, written up in our Haskell for\nTypescript Devs book\n[https://haskellfortypescriptdevs.fission.codes/appendix/haskell-wizards]:\n\nSCREAMING SNAKE CASE [https://blog.fission.codes/screaming-snake-case/]  was\njust a pure piece of fun, with the vaporwave stylings pushed to the max. We did\na first run of stickers with this image, and can't wait to come up with t-shirts\nor other swag with this fun image:\n\nVote for developer jargon to illustrate\nWe're going to get some more illustrations made, and have a couple of ideas\nalready:\n\n 1. Kebab case  wouldn't be vaporwave, but maybe a sort of comic / graphic art –\n    a delicious kebab, dripping sauce.\n 2. The Elm programming language  is a favourite of ours at Fission, so vote for\n    this one if you want an Elm-y character in the style of the Haskell Wizards\n 3. We recently added some definitions for Yak shaving to our forum\n    [https://talk.fission.codes/t/yak-shaving-programming-term/582]. It's only\n    about 20 years old – but of course software development has changed\n    dramatically in the last 20 years, so it's a term that's not well known.\n 4. Bike shedding  and\n 5. Pets vs. Cattle are the last two suggestions we have so far.\n\nRead more about these ideas, vote in the forum for your favourites to get\nillustrated, or suggest your own »\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/vote-for-and-suggest-developer-concepts-to-illustrate/590]\n\nWe're working with Bruno now, and will run the vote for a couple of weeks, and\nthen get at least 2 or 3 of the developer jargon ideas turned into high quality\nillustrations.\n\nPost header photo by Lieve Ransijn\n[https://unsplash.com/@lievemax?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText] \n on Unsplash\n[https://unsplash.com/s/photos/yak?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText]","html":"<p>We're creating illustrations for developer concepts, catch phrases, and other jargon. <em>Yak shaving</em> is one of those terms.
