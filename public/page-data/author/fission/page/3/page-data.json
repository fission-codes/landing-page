What if data and services\nnever had to leave our phones?\n\n> There is the potential today to reclaim control of our digital lives from\nmonopolist platforms and unnecessary rent-seeking. There is a world within reach\nwhere always-on, always-connected pocket computers become personal data stores.\nAll your photos, documents, messages, and other data live with you, not on a\nfaceless server belonging to a random corporation. The only machine learning\ndone is done for you. Data only leaves your device because you want to send it\nsomewhere.\nThe author is careful to balance this aspirational scenario with what are\ngenuine challenges. It will take significant work to realise this vision,\nincluding rethinking the current internet hub-and-spoke model, increasing\nadoption of IPv6, opening up radio spectrums, and extensive user education.\nThough daunting, these are not insurmountable: the activists' best ally is a\ndogged preference for incremental progress over time.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHave you ever tried to host your own site through with ENS + IPFS?

It is stored on a server, and the\nname almonit.club is registered with a regular name service (DNS). To access\nalmonit.club, the browser first asks the DNS in which server it is stored, and\nthen gets the website from that server. With almonit.eth website we took a bit\ndifferent approach. Instead of a server, we use IPFS, and instead of DNS, we use\nENS.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's not often that new handheld gaming devices get announced. Playdate\n[https://play.date/], the brain child of veteran software shop Panic's Play\n[https://panic.com/], incorporates a delightfully odd crank that games can use\nfor play mechanics.

There is a world within reach where always-on, always-connected pocket computers become personal data stores. All your photos, documents, messages, and other data live with you, not on a faceless server belonging to a random corporation. The only machine learning done is done for you. Data only leaves your device because you want to send it somewhere.</blockquote><p>The author is careful to balance this aspirational scenario with what are genuine challenges. It will take significant work to realise this vision, including rethinking the current internet hub-and-spoke model, increasing adoption of IPv6, opening up radio spectrums, and extensive user education. Though daunting, these are not insurmountable: the activists' best ally is a dogged preference for incremental progress over time.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>Have you ever tried to host your own site through with ENS + IPFS? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DestinerX\">Timur</a> pointed us to a <a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/list-of_ENSIPFS-websites.html\"><strong>List of ENS+IPFS websites</strong></a><strong> </strong>that have done this successfully, including the blog at the link<strong>.</strong> Also check out this great <a href=\"https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/ENSIPFS-Part-1-Introduction.html\">series of tutorials</a> detailing how to do it for yourself!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-06.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><blockquote>Almonit.club is hosted like a normal website.
