Turns out quite a bit. We're looking at the note-taking system\nknown as \"Zettlekasten,\" and how you can use Fission and TiddlyWiki\n[https://blog.fission.codes/announcing-tiddlywiki-on-fission/]to create your own\nversion. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is Niklas Luhmann. Niklas was a prolific scholar and writer--he wrote and\npublished more than 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles.\n\nThis is Niklas LuhmannNiklas Luhmann was such an intellectually productive\nbadass because of the relatively ingenious yet straightforward note-taking\nmethod he developed known as “Zettelkasten.” Like so many other German words,\nZettelkasten as a word is both literal and perfectly descriptive. “Zettel” means\nslip or note, and “kasten” means box. In essence, the Zettelkasten method is\nabout creating a box (or any storage receptacle) in which to keep notes.\n\nHow Zettelkasten works\nTo use the Zettelkasten method, you only need three simple things:\n\n * A way to take notes\n * A system with bidirectional linking\n * A collection of tags\n\nThat’s it! But now, let’s break down each piece a little bit.\n\nA note-taking system\nLuhmann was old school--he owned no computers and used paper, pens, and a\ntypewriter for most of his impressive writing career. He didn’t even type very\nquickly--he used the hunt and peck method.\n\nIn fact, his Zettelkasten was literally a box of notes in the form of a piece of\nfurniture--sort of like a card catalog.\n\nNot Luhmann's Zettelkasten, but you get the idea\n\nWhile Luhmann’s Zettelkasten was a piece of furniture stuffed with slips of\npaper, today, the concept translates very well to any of the many digital\nnote-taking systems available. Web apps like Evernote, Notion, and Google Keep\noffer free or low-cost ways to take notes on desktop or mobile devices.\nTiddlyWiki is also a great option because of it’s bidirectional linking power,\nwhich is the next crucial ingredient of a Zettelkasten.\n\nA system with bidirectional linking\nSo what is bidirectional linking? It’s exactly what it sounds like--the ability\nto connect ideas back and forth to each other in more than one direction. One\npopular option of a program with this capability is the paid product Roam\nResearch; however, TiddlyWiki offers bidirectional linking function in its free,\nopen-source program.\n\nA collection of tags\nThe last component of a Zettelkasten is a collection of tags, or labels, for\nyour thoughts/entries. We’re used to seeing tags used frequently with blog posts\nor online articles. On the Fission blog, we use categories like security, apps,\nopen-source, or headless to help readers find relevant content. Categorizing\nyour ideas with different tags allows you to find relevant information in a\nnote-taking system quickly. And because one idea may have more than one tag, you\ncan easily find the relevant idea from any number of search terms.\n\nUsing TiddlyWiki for Zettelkasten\nThe great thing about TiddlyWiki is that it gives us the three things we need to\nuse the Zettelkasten system.\n\n 1. A note-taking method.\n 2. Bidirectional linking\n 3. A system of Tags\n\nTiddlyWiki offers a note-taking method with its simple interface with entries\ncalled “Tiddlers.” A new Tiddler looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nTiddlers are simple to tag. In our example, I added three different tags--open\nsource, super rad ideas, and TiddlyWiki:\n\n\n\nLet’s create a second note. This one is titled “Even New Tiddler.” And for this\none, I only added one tag--Super rad ideas:\n\n\n\n\nNow, if you search for Tiddlers with the tag “Super rad ideas,” both of our\nTiddlers come up in the search results:\n\n\n\nTiddlyWiki and Fission\nAs you can see, TiddlyWiki provides a simple and effective way to organize your\nnotes using the Zettelkasten method. And now that TiddlyWiki is building a\nversion of the TiddlyWiki app on the Fission platform, users will have a web\nnative option to share content across browsers and devices. You get all of the\nbenefits of TiddlyWiki’s open-source program for note-taking, tagging, and\nbidirectional linking, while Fission acts as a flexible container for your\nZettelkasten. And Fission’s strong encryption keeps your data secure and\nprotected.\n\nWe are working on this project out in the open. You can check out the \nTiddlyWiki\ngroup on the Fission forum [https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  to\nkeep track of this project. You can look for the launch of TiddlyWiki for\nFission later this spring!\n\nAlso, check out the Fission Discord\n[https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/478735028319158277], where we\nare having lots of exciting conversations with other devs about current projects\nand all things open source.

When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into\ntheir data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:\n\n 1. We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers,\n    called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)\n 2. Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted\n    and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and\n    can’t see your content.\n 3. We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as\n    possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few\n    third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.\n\n> Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.\nAt Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built\ninto modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a\nprivate encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.\n\nBy the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default Fission\nDrive app [https://drive.fission.codes]  and create a new Fission account.\nNotice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it\ndoesn’t ask you for a password.\n\nTo use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or\nphone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to\nanother device that already has permission.\n\nNow, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have\npermission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all\nwithout setting up or having to remember a password.\n\nApple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps\neveryone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking\nthe same approach.\n\nWhat about lost devices?\nBut what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the\nencrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now,\nthe answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API\nbuilt into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for\nsecurity reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover\nyour encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.\n\nOne of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of\ndefault use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do\nrely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards\nbased on the real world support available in all major browsers, including\nmobile browsers.\n\nUsing a single-device as a base case\nLet’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile\ncomputing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that\none mobile device means you’ve lost everything.\n\nThis is the common base case we need to keep in mind.\n\nIt’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is\nmuch easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop\ndevice. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around\nfor a really long time.\n\nIn fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the \nprivate key they used to securely connect to GitHub\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh] \n was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of\nowning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!\n\nBut since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to\nplan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system\naccessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.\n\nSplitting up keys\nOur basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces.\nWe then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user\naccount.\n\nThe other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.\n\nWhen the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it\ncreates the complete key that can access the person’s account.\n\nBecause of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.\n\n> If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret\nkeys to leak.\nWhere should I store recovery codes?\nOn Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating\nsystem — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included.\nWe’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their\nSafari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.\n\nOn Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google\nservices built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to\nusing iCloud in our iOS example.\n\nAdvanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in\nApple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password\naccount, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.\n\nSignal's Note to Self feature\n[https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self]And in\nthe future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious\nusers to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage\nbackup keys.\n\nGet involved\nYou can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our Account Recovery\ndesign process [https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432]  in the\nforum.\n\nWe’re not done with our design.

The Fission team takes this time to talk about new releases\n& product updates, early demos of in-progress work, planned roadmap items and\nopen Q&A. We also invite the community to come and give app demos.\n\nMeet the Team\nWe were joined by three new people this month. Philipp in 🇩🇪 Germany, Brian in\n🇺🇸 Oregon, United States, and Helder in 🇧🇷 Brazil.\n\nPhilipp is working on the Account Dashboard, on both the Elm app and additional\nfeatures in the Fission Haskell server.\n\nBrian is working on the Filecoin Grant Project, and will be building the Backup\nApp in Svelte.\n\nHelder is working on a proof-of-concept around Headless Ghost, and will be\nmoving on to assist with implementation of Fission's new home page, which will\nbe using our current Ghost blog that you're reading this on.\n\nFission Product Updates & Demos\n * Account Dashboard by @matheus23 [https://talk.fission.codes/u/matheus23]:  \n   this is the account dashboard for Fission platform services. Everyone will\n   manage their account basics there, but also security around device linking\n   management, account recovery setup, and more. Developers will manage the apps\n   that they publish on the platform. Built in Elm as all of our 1st party apps\n   are, you can find it on github: https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard\n * App Generator by @bgins [https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins]: a tool to help\n   you create manifest files and other settings for Progressive Web Apps (PWA).\n   Built in Elm, find it on github: \n   https://github.com/fission-suite/pwa-generator\n * Fission Github Publish Action by @walkah\n   [https://talk.fission.codes/u/walkah]: For git-based-workflows and teams, add\n   this to your code repo on Github to automatically publish to Fission.\n   Consider it in alpha (we haven't made an official release yet), James will be\n   writing more about it, but it is live and works today on github: \n   https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action\n\nRoadmap Items\n * CLI Linking: coming soon, developer account linking on your desktop.\n * Account Recovery [https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432]: we're\n   working on an account recovery flow. With password-less logins tied to your\n   devices and encryption, we need to design it in such a way that Fission can\n   help you recover your private files, without having access to those files\n   ourselves. We'll be sharing blog posts, flows, and security & cryptography\n   considerations as we roll this out.\n * Customized Login\n   [https://talk.fission.codes/t/customized-login-branding/1431]: Make a custom\n   branded sign-in experience without having to write your own login code.\n   Include design, logo, and custom text as part of the authorization lobby.\n   This will likely be our first premium paid developer feature.\n * Headless Ghost [https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-ghost-on-fission/1407]:\n   this blog runs on Ghost. We're planning on re-doing the home page and\n   integrating in the blog more directly in a \"Headless\" style. We'll be sharing\n   open source code starter kits so anyone can build this.\n * Headless WordPress: many of the server-focused systems like Ghost and\n   WordPress are seeing interest in \"headless\" mode: keep the editing interface,\n   but have a static, serverless front end.

The Fission team takes this time to talk about new releases &amp; product updates, early demos of in-progress work, planned roadmap items and open Q&amp;A. We also invite the community to come and give app demos.</p><h2 id=\"meet-the-team\">Meet the Team</h2><p>We were joined by three new people this month. Philipp in 🇩🇪 Germany, Brian in 🇺🇸 Oregon, United States, and Helder in 🇧🇷 Brazil.</p><p>Philipp is working on the Account Dashboard, on both the Elm app and additional features in the Fission Haskell server.</p><p>Brian is working on the Filecoin Grant Project, and will be building the Backup App in Svelte.</p><p>Helder is working on a proof-of-concept around Headless Ghost, and will be moving on to assist with implementation of Fission's new home page, which will be using our current Ghost blog that you're reading this on.</p><h2 id=\"fission-product-updates-demos\">Fission Product Updates &amp; Demos</h2><ul><li>Account Dashboard by <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/u/matheus23\">@matheus23</a>:<strong> </strong>this is the account dashboard for Fission platform services. Everyone will manage their account basics there, but also security around device linking management, account recovery setup, and more. Developers will manage the apps that they publish on the platform. Built in Elm as all of our 1st party apps are, you can find it on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard\">https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard</a></li><li>App Generator by <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins\">@bgins</a>: a tool to help you create manifest files and other settings for Progressive Web Apps (PWA). Built in Elm, find it on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/pwa-generator\">https://github.com/fission-suite/pwa-generator</a></li><li>Fission Github Publish Action by <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/u/walkah\">@walkah</a>: For git-based-workflows and teams, add this to your code repo on Github to automatically publish to Fission. Consider it in alpha (we haven't made an official release yet), James will be writing more about it, but it is live and works today on github: <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action\">https://github.com/fission-suite/publish-action</a></li></ul><h2 id=\"roadmap-items\">Roadmap Items</h2><ul><li>CLI Linking: coming soon, developer account linking on your desktop.</li><li><a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432\">Account Recovery</a>: we're working on an account recovery flow. With password-less logins tied to your devices and encryption, we need to design it in such a way that Fission can help you recover your private files, without having access to those files ourselves. We'll be sharing blog posts, flows, and security &amp; cryptography considerations as we roll this out.</li><li><a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/t/customized-login-branding/1431\">Customized Login</a>: Make a custom branded sign-in experience without having to write your own login code. Include design, logo, and custom text as part of the authorization lobby. This will likely be our first premium paid developer feature.</li><li><a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-ghost-on-fission/1407\">Headless Ghost</a>: this blog runs on Ghost. We're planning on re-doing the home page and integrating in the blog more directly in a \"Headless\" style. We'll be sharing open source code starter kits so anyone can build this.</li><li>Headless WordPress: many of the server-focused systems like Ghost and WordPress are seeing interest in \"headless\" mode: keep the editing interface, but have a static, serverless front end. We've got a mini project with a live customer, and we'll be using that as a test case and document and share how anyone can do this.</li></ul><h2 id=\"community-demo\">Community Demo<br></h2><p>Rosano, who <a href=\"https://blog.fission.codes/rosano-zero-data-apps-remote-storage/\">joined us for a great discussion back on January 14th</a>, came back to do a demo and walk through of his <a href=\"https://hyperdraft.rosano.ca/\">HyperDraft notes app</a>.</p><h2 id=\"video\">Video</h2><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/503380389?app_id=122963\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Fission Demo Day January 2021\"></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><h2 id=\"join-us-next-time\">Join us next time</h2><p>We're experimenting with <a href=\"https://lu.ma\">Luma</a> for registering for events.
