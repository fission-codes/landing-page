Python is 28 years old, and\nthe context is — how does it stay relevant for the next 10 years? How does it\nplan to do things, to remain relevant? And what “black swan” events does Python\nneed to be prepared for?\n\nThe essential topic is, Python has been around for 28 years; how does it make\nsure it stays around for 10 more years? Covers “black swan” events, open source\ncommunity norms, WASM, volunteerism vs. funding experts, contributor burn out,\nand more.\n\nTake Aways for Ethereum\nA lot of this is familiar to be me because I have a long history with open\nsource projects. But, that’s history: one big point is that we need to be\nthinking about — and planning for! — the future of collaborative projects. From\nmy recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot\nabout the topics covered.\n\nI feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the\n“Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming\nmore traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.\n\nAlexey’s article about Eth1x\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60] \n highlights this shift well: a shift in who  works on research and\nimplementation, and a shift in how  the process is changing and needs to\ncontinue to evolve.\n\n> Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation\nteams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group\nand start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires\nfinding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But\nat least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable\nprocess.\n\n— Alexey Akhunov\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60]\nIn other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes after \ngrowth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the Ethereum Foundation\n[https://ethereum.foundation]  actively divest itself of core responsibilities.\n\nOh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years\nstill co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.\n\nIf I could, I would want to get up on stage at DevCon5 [https://devcon.org]  and\nessentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.\n\nHere are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:\n\nBecoming Open Source\nEthereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need\nto spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and\niteratively making things better.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that\nget assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.\n\nEvery day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying\ncry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er”\nmindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei\n\nI am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository\nnorms (issues & PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source\nexperience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue,\nbettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new\ncode contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.\n\nOpen Source Licensing & Funding isn’t a Solved Problem\nOpen source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning\nfrom other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead\nin experiments in these areas.\n\nOpen source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There\nis a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down\nadoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around\nopen source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate\nrevenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.\n\nFunding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say\nthat only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project\ntradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate\nopen source awareness into their thinking.\n\nEmbrace the Ethereum Stack\nI’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC\nmiddleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language,\nthe EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of\nthese are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and\ncollaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains,\nsidechains, and private enterprise contexts.\n\nThis is a strength if  we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum.\nWhile still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the\nentire stack can benefit from and link into.\n\nThe Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and\nsupporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.\n\nWe’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog\nfor Ethereum Stack) on the RUN EVM site [https://RUNEVM.com]. And yet, I was\nstill surprised to see ThoughtWorks Radar highlight “EVM beyond Ethereum”\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link]\n; it’s in their “Trial” category, one before “Adopt” recommendation.\n\nEVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms]Ethereum’s Black Swans\nWhat disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might\naffect Ethereum? Even while thinking about distributed ledger technology and\nrelated decentralized web tech as a disruption itself, we need to look at how\nthe Ethereum stack fits into other changes.\n\nWASM\nThe community is already working on improving the EVM and making the transition\nto WASM [3], which is mentioned in the video.\n\nSolidity, as a major programming language in the ecosystem, in part “competes”\nwith Python. On the other hand, enabling the Python developer community to write\nEthereum compatible smart contracts is a huge win for our community. This is why\nI want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other\nlanguage developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is,\nit’s not duplication, it’s forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for\nother language compatibility as well).\n\nMobile as a Programming Environment\nPersonally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for\nEthereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the\nsame “make Ethereum programming work from your phone” opportunity and threat\nhighlighted by Russell.\n\nSince Ethereum chains run continuously as a global “backend” — I see this as an\nopportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written\n& deployed from mobile devices today — with Ethereum blockchains providing a\nshared backend. This is connected to the “hostless” theme that we are following\nat FISSION.\n\nWhat should we work on?\nThe entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open\nsource, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.\n\nHere are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum\ncommunity can work on:\n\n 1. Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code\n    collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments\n    and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.\n 2. Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of\n    the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.\n\nFISSION’s mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider\ndevelopment community by solving real problems today & exploring fundamental\nshifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans. I look forward\nto completing this mission alongside the growth of the Ethereum community.\n\nSign up if you want to get involved as an alpha tester »\n[https://tools.fission.codes]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Reading\nI haven’t read Elisabeth Ostrom’s 1990 book, “Governing the Commons: The\nEvolution of Institutions for Collective Action“.

From my recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I’ve been thinking a lot about the topics covered.</p><p>I feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I’ve started calling this the “Ethereum Stack”, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming more traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.</p><p>Alexey’s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60\">article about Eth1x</a> highlights this shift well: a shift in <em>who</em> works on research and implementation, and a shift in <em>how</em> the process is changing and needs to continue to evolve.</p><blockquote>Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation teams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group and start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires finding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But at least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable process.<br><br>— <a href=\"https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60\">Alexey Akhunov</a></blockquote><p>In other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes <em>after</em> growth of the community. We’re in the midst of seeing the <a href=\"https://ethereum.foundation\">Ethereum Foundation</a> actively divest itself of core responsibilities.</p><p>Oh, and if you don’t know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years still co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.</p><p>If I could, I would want to get up on stage at <a href=\"https://devcon.org\">DevCon5</a> and essentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.</p><p>Here are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:</p><h3 id=\"becoming-open-source\">Becoming Open Source</h3><p>Ethereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need to spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and iteratively making things better.</p><p>What does this mean? It means turning “this sucks” into actionable items, that get assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.</p><p>Every day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying cry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and “do-er” mindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei</p><p>I am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository norms (issues &amp; PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source experience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue, bettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new code contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.</p><h3 id=\"open-source-licensing-funding-isn-t-a-solved-problem\">Open Source Licensing &amp; Funding isn’t a Solved Problem</h3><p>Open source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning from other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead in experiments in these areas.</p><p>Open source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There is a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down adoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around open source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate revenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.</p><p>Funding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say that only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project tradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate open source awareness into their thinking.</p><h3 id=\"embrace-the-ethereum-stack\">Embrace the Ethereum Stack</h3><p>I’ve started to think about Ethereum as the “Ethereum Stack” — the EVM, JSON-RPC middleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language, the EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes — all of these are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and collaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains, sidechains, and private enterprise contexts.</p><p>This is a strength <strong>if</strong> we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum. While still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the entire stack can benefit from and link into.</p><p>The Ethereum community’s “specification first” approach to building software and supporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.</p><p>We’ve been gathering EVM-related news (I’m realizing that EVM is another analog for Ethereum Stack) on the <a href=\"https://RUNEVM.com\">RUN EVM site</a>. And yet, I was still surprised to see <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link\">ThoughtWorks Radar highlight “EVM beyond Ethereum”</a>; it’s in their “Trial” category, one before “Adopt” recommendation.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/05/00DB9795-115B-4E74-98A8-AE80D84D9566.png\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>EVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of <a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms\">ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id=\"ethereum-s-black-swans\">Ethereum’s Black Swans</h2><p>What disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might affect Ethereum?

Fred Armisen’s character reminisces\nabout a time where the norm was “getting piercings, tribal tattoos, singing\nabout saving the planet and forming bands” — and then reveals the vision is\nstill alive in Portland, today. \"The hot girls wear glasses, people are content\nto be unambitious!\" The sketch satirically romanticises a return to the past\nreality of 1990s US youth culture.\n\nWe’ve observed the inverse occur in crypto, a desire to not abandon possible\nfutures.\n\nIn this case, a future near and dear to a cypherpunk’s heart, the “Web3 vision\nof Ethereum”  —  data sovereignty, uncensorable distributed storage, and private\ncommunication baked in as defaults. Projects like IPFS, Swarm and Whisper were\nheralded as coequal participants in the distributed revolution.\n\nIuri’s tweet is just the most recent example of a common sentiment in the space:\n\n> Very sad this mentality switch we're seeing from the original web3 vision of\nEthereum to a blockchain-focused for finance-only one, a la bitcoin. \nhttps://t.co/rkzj4BlsMU\n\n— iuri “not Luri” matias (@iurimatias) April 26, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/iurimatias/status/1121796404672733184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nIt’s not just the loss of a Web3 vision that brings people down. It’s the active\npresence of scam projects and unsavory characters that permeate the ecosystem.\nAre we doomed to the excesses of fraudulent ICOs, IEOs,  of privacy destroying\ndata extraction until the heat-death of the universe?\n\nThe short answer is no, of course not.\n\nFirst, let’s step back and look around a bit more broadly — Why do some people\nthink Web3 has been abandoned in favor of things like DeFi? (Decentralised\nFinance if you aren’t familiar: financial instruments like Dharma\n[https://www.dharma.io/], Set [https://www.setprotocol.com/], Compound\n[https://compound.finance/])\n\nIn a phrase, product-market fit happened. Look at the following points:\n\n 1. the 2017 bull market left those that sold the top flush with new cash.\n 2. DeFi products have matured enough over 2018 and the beignning of 2019 to\n    have functioning releases. These are relatively straightforward protocols\n    that have engaged user bases, monetisation paths, etc.\n 3. Web3 (including Swarm, IPFS, Whisper and the coordination protocols building\n    on top of them) was always a long term, more complex objective.\n 4. Novel ways of organising human effort is a big task to see through. DAOs\n    like those from Aragon [https://aragon.org/], Colony [https://colony.io/], \n    Daostack [https://daostack.io/]  are going to need a lot more tooling and\n    experimentation, which is fortunately happening today.\n\nEthereum still has a relatively small community, so it’s easy to get stuck in a\nnarrative bubble. And while narratives are important for uniting communities, no\nsingle group can control what ends up being built, whether that's a dapp for\nmanaging your collateralised loan or a DAO for your co-op. \n\nWEB3 VISION OUTSIDE OF CRYPTO\nThe reality is that outside of Ethereum mainchain there are dev communities\ninterested in data sovereignty — it’s just referred to by different names,\nincluding local-first software, hostless & local compute.\n\nDevelopers interested in these types of constructions often have similar\nmotivations as the Web3 community; user privacy, distributed collaboration,\naversion to corporate data mining. IPFS has seen growth both within and without\ncrypto through developers passionate about these ideals.\n\nThe Ink & Switch team recently posted a great writeup on what they call\nlocal-first software [https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html]:\n\n> In this article we propose “local-first software”: a set of principles for\nsoftware that enables both collaboration and  ownership for users. Local-first\nideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple\ndevices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and\nuser control of data.\nThe authors include a list of 7 benefits  that come from using local-first\nsolutions, which will resonate with the crypto community:\n\n 1. No spinners: your work at your fingertips\n 2. Your work is not trapped on one device\n 3. The network is optional\n 4. Seamless collaboration with colleagues\n 5. The Long Now — able to access and edit over extended timelines\n 6. Security and privacy by default\n 7. You retain ultimate control\n\nHere’s a demo of a sample app called Trellis\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9fdyDlhByM]  that duplicates Trello\nfunctionality onto a offline machine. Distributed teams working on the same\nboard can then be synced to a canonical version, all without using a cloud\nprovider.\n\nThe discussion within the Ethereum community continues of course – there are\ndapps and protocols being built around decentralized web use cases, while\nfinancial use cases continue to grow as well.\n\nWorking with FISSION\nI’ve recently begun working with the team at FISSION [https://fission.codes].

Fred Armisen’s character reminisces about a time where the norm was “getting piercings, tribal tattoos, singing about saving the planet and forming bands” — and then reveals the vision is still alive in Portland, today. \"The hot girls wear glasses, people are content to be unambitious!\" The sketch satirically romanticises a return to the past reality of 1990s US youth culture.</p><p>We’ve observed the inverse occur in crypto, <strong>a desire to not abandon possible futures</strong>.</p><p>In this case, a future near and dear to a cypherpunk’s heart, the “Web3 vision of Ethereum”  —  data sovereignty, uncensorable distributed storage, and private communication baked in as defaults. Projects like IPFS, Swarm and Whisper were heralded as coequal participants in the distributed revolution.</p><p>Iuri’s tweet is just the most recent example of a common sentiment in the space:</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Very sad this mentality switch we&#39;re seeing from the original web3 vision of Ethereum to a blockchain-focused for finance-only one, a la bitcoin. <a href=\"https://t.co/rkzj4BlsMU\">https://t.co/rkzj4BlsMU</a></p>&mdash; iuri “not Luri” matias (@iurimatias) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iurimatias/status/1121796404672733184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 26, 2019</a></blockquote>\n<script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>It’s not just the loss of a Web3 vision that brings people down. It’s the active presence of scam projects and unsavory characters that permeate the ecosystem. Are we doomed to the excesses of fraudulent ICOs, IEOs,  of privacy destroying data extraction until the heat-death of the universe?</p><p><strong>The short answer is no, of course not.</strong></p><p>First, let’s step back and look around a bit more broadly — Why do some people think Web3 has been abandoned in favor of things like DeFi? (Decentralised Finance if you aren’t familiar: financial instruments like <a href=\"https://www.dharma.io/\" rel=\"noopener\">Dharma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.setprotocol.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Set</a>, <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\" rel=\"noopener\">Compound</a>)</p><p>In a phrase, product-market fit happened. Look at the following points:</p><ol><li>the 2017 bull market left those that sold the top flush with new cash.</li><li>DeFi products have matured enough over 2018 and the beignning of 2019 to have functioning releases. These are relatively straightforward protocols that have engaged user bases, monetisation paths, etc.</li><li>Web3 (including Swarm, IPFS, Whisper and the coordination protocols building on top of them) was always a long term, more complex objective.</li><li>Novel ways of organising human effort is a big task to see through.
