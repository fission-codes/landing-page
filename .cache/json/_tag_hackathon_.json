If Youtube (Y2) is a legacy system that can censor\nusers and withhold payments for content, Y3 is an exploration towards a future\nwhere new possibilities open up. Self-hosted, replicated content can't be taken\ndown, and payments over Ethereum are censorship resistant to a high degree.\n\nThe first step for users is to be running or have access to an IPFS node. After\nloading their content into the IPFS interface [https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs],\nusers submit a content hash to the Y3 onchain Ethereum contract. The video\nmetadata gets stored in a contract array to be accessed later by users.\n\nPayment, if required, would be handled via a Python script, conditional upon\nsuccessful delivery of content from the IPFS network. The contract would then\ncall a function that sets up the transaction. This is one thing that still needs\nto be developed for the project to operate properly. According to Kian, ¬†this\nkind of payment scheme wouldn't be practical in reality: \n\n> Instead, an implementation of either state channels or probabilistic\nmicropayments ‚Äìwith the total time of video content already streamed taken to be\nthe primary metric for payment ‚Äì would be more apt.\nHLS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming]  (HTTP Live Streaming)\nand IPNS [https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/]  (InterPlanetary Naming\nSystem) integrations are also still under development. For now, Y3 can only\nserve static content. IPNS would make those links mutable, and would update the\ncontent address as new chunks of data come in.\n\nOther important libraries used are web3.JS\n[https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/], Infura's API\n[https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/makeRequests.md]  for Ethereum\nintegration, and FFmpeg [https://ffmpeg.org/]  for HLS capable video editing.\n\nIn the future, Kian would like to add a more intuitive frontend. The FISSION\nteam is looking forward to seeing where the project ends up and what functions\nhe can integrate!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here are a few additional questions we had Kian answer about his\nbackground and the hackathon itself:\n\nWhat‚Äôs your background as a developer?\n\nI‚Äôm currently 21, and so I‚Äôm still pursuing my undergrad. As an Engineering\nPhysics major, I‚Äôm not left with a lot of time during the semester to develop\nEthereum-related projects, but do develop data processing and machine learning\nsoftware professionally. When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the\ndecentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I‚Äôve been to two ETHGlobal\nevents, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech ‚Äî a\ndecentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation\napplication.\n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?\n\nI along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of\nmouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies.\nOut of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my\ncolleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these\npopular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for\nourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical\nand worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a\nheightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and\ncutting-edge developments in the space.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nFor tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is\na very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very\nactive on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the\nresult is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel\nconcepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you‚Äôre forced to\njudge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out,\nwhile the upside is that you‚Äôre exposed to ideas soon after they‚Äôre born.\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nOne of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of\nsponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful\nand exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers\npresent, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.\n\nWhat inspired Y3?\n\nA video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized\ntechnologies where the benefits are very obvious to see ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have go\nthrough leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a\nplatform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that\nwe‚Äôve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all\nkinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly\nengaging. This luxury, however, isn‚Äôt afforded to the billions of people around\nthe world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency.\nThus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the\npursuit of its realization is noble.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS?\n\nIPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store\nthe contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution,\nit was fairly elegant ‚Äì the only major disadvantage being the lack of\npersistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being\naddressed by developers of the protocol.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nConnecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate\nPython client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest\nchallenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for\nHLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate\nof incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network\nconnectivity).\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nAfter expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly\nintegrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from\nLivepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their\nprojects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to\nIPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents\nperiodically.\n\nAny plans to keep working on the project?\n\nYes. My application does not completely function as intended. I will finish\nproperly implementing HLS functionality and then go on to share the project\nonline.\n\nIn hindsight what‚Äôs something you may have done differently for either the\nproject or the hackathon?\n\nI actually anticipated the issue that I had regarding the implementation of HLS\nfunctionality with IPFS before I even started the project. In hindsight, I\nshould have sought out a solution to my problem well before I ever encountered\nit.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThanks Kian for spending time to help get this post ready for others to learn\nfrom.

When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the decentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I‚Äôve been to two ETHGlobal events, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech ‚Äî a decentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation application.</p><p><strong>What got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?</strong></p><p>I along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of mouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies. Out of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my colleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these popular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for ourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical and worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a heightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and cutting-edge developments in the space.</p><p><strong>Where do you go to read tech news / developer news?</strong></p><p>For tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is a very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very active on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the result is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel concepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you‚Äôre forced to judge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out, while the upside is that you‚Äôre exposed to ideas soon after they‚Äôre born.</p><p><strong>In general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?</strong></p><p>One of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of sponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful and exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers present, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.</p><p><strong>What inspired Y3?</strong></p><p>A video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized technologies where the benefits are very obvious to see ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have go through leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a platform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that we‚Äôve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all kinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly engaging. This luxury, however, isn‚Äôt afforded to the billions of people around the world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency. Thus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the pursuit of its realization is noble.</p><p><strong>What made you want to integrate IPFS?</strong></p><p>IPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store the contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution, it was fairly elegant ‚Äì the only major disadvantage being the lack of persistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being addressed by developers of the protocol.</p><p><strong>What challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?</strong></p><p>Connecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate Python client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest challenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for HLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate of incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network connectivity).</p><p><strong>What was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon participants?</strong></p><p>After expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly integrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from Livepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their projects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to IPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents periodically.</p><p><strong>Any plans to keep working on the project?</strong></p><p>Yes. My application does not completely function as intended. I will finish properly implementing HLS functionality and then go on to share the project online.</p><p><strong>In hindsight what‚Äôs something you may have done differently for either the project or the hackathon?</strong></p><p>I actually anticipated the issue that I had regarding the implementation of HLS functionality with IPFS before I even started the project. In hindsight, I should have sought out a solution to my problem well before I ever encountered it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2019/06/blog-header-image-18.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><br>Thanks Kian for spending time to help get this post ready for others to learn from.

First we'll look at how the project works,\nfollowed by a few questions FISSION asked the team about their background.\n\nHackathon Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/0xsu-ethereum-short-urls\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/du4e\n\nHow 0xSU works\n\"Think of it like goo.gl except it can't be taken down.\" In theory, URL\nshorteners could censor a link or decline to continue forwarding requests. By\ndeploying to the public Ethereum chain, creating open source proxy servers and\nutilising a distributed storage layer like IPFS, much of that risk is avoided. \n\nBefore using 0xSU, users need to make sure they have either a traditional\nweb-browser like Chrome plus wallet extension (ie Metamask\n[https://metamask.io/]) or through a Web3 browser like Status\n[https://status.im/]  or Coinbase Wallet [https://wallet.coinbase.com/]. If\nthat's ready, they can navigate to 0xSU.co [https://0xsu.co/]  with the URL they\nwant to shorten and store immutably. The web3 frontend is hosted through IPFS,\nmeaning everything needed to make this work properly already exists outside of a\ncentralised server. Currently, the node is hosted through Digital Ocean.\n\nOnce on the site, users submit the link along with a small amount of Ether to\ncover associated gas costs. Under the hood, the link is written into the\ncontract (address on Etherscan\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x19624ffa41fe26744e74fdbba77bef967a222d4c]) as a\nkey value pair: the full link and the shortened one. The backend sits onchain in\nthe contract, accessed via either a helper js library\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-js-lib]  or one of the open source 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  proxy servers: flask\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-flask-server], sinatra\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-sinatra-server], or express\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-express-server].\n\nAdditionally, the url shortener doesn't work without an http redirect, so they\nwrote open source forwarding proxies that enable this and anyone can run. The\nproject currently uses Quiknode [https://quiknode.io/]  as the Web3 provider to\nsupply a node that the forwarders can hook into.\n\nGiven that the code is open source, anyone could fork the front end and run\ntheir own forwarding instance. In the future, users could get served ads to\noffset the cost of forwarding. Alternatively, the team is also looking at\nintegrating the Gas Station Network\n[https://medium.com/groundhog-network/the-gas-station-network-alliance-6fd543e7eca3]\n, a collaboration between Ethereum organisations that cover the cost of gas for\nonboarding new users and subsidised apps.\n\nIn the future, the project will have to consider the implications of state rent\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arw0au/what_is_state_rent_in_ethereum_and_how_does_it/]\n. Users, or the Gas Station Network might have to provide an additional payment\nto wake a dormant contract back into state. A partial workaround for this could\nbe to cache the high traffic URLs in something like Heroku. \n\nFuture UI improvements might include adding a Wyre [https://www.sendwyre.com/] \nintegration to allow users to use credit cards instead of maintaining a\ncompatible wallet. The team hopes to continue working on it as a side project.\n\nHere's a quick video demo of 0xSU in action:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here's a set of questions we had the team answer:\n\nWhat is your developer background?\n\nJon: I graduated from a full-stack coding bootcamp about a month ago. Before\nthat I just dabbled a little with JavaScript.\n\nAuston: I am a self-taught developer who started writing code about 12 years\nago. I am always interested in learning new languages & Solidity / Ethereum are\nsuper powerful conceptually. \n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralisation initially? \n\nJon: I found the idea of the blockchain and its serverless application\nfascinating. I wanted to learn more and my research told me the Ethereum network\nis the best run place to start.\n\nAuston: For me it started in 2011 when my friend Michael had a little hacker\nmeetup & decided to talk about bitcoin. I dismissed it initially but eventually\ncame around to the idea. Finally my friend Kai reached out in 2017 & told me\nabout Ethereum, that‚Äôs when I really started to dive deep, as I realized there\nwas now a censorship resistant platform that could be built upon.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nJon: hackernoon, medium, techcrunch, dev.to [http://dev.to/]\n\nAuston: I love hacker news! Twitter is always fun to discover random things & on\noccasion, Hacker Noon. \n\nDo you listen to any technology or developer podcasts?\n\nJon: I would if I found the time.\n\nAuston: Shill time! I have been working on a podcast for a few weeks with my\nfriend Jose, you can go listen to it on the Devshirts' site\n[https://devshirts.co/blogs/podcasts].\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nJon: Was pretty interesting and inspiring. It was my first time and I didn‚Äôt\nknow where to begin, but luckily I teamed up with Auston who is a nice guy &\nhelped guide me.\n\nAuston: It was really invigorating to see so many people hyped up about Ethereum\n& working on Dapps. I definitely appreciated the sponsor dev support, we\nlaunched a node on quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  and got some help from\nthen sendwyre.com [http://sendwyre.com/]  team. Also was super cool to get some\nhelp from Vitalik himself debugging an issue with our smart contract. \n\nWhat inspired the project? \n\nGoo.gl [http://goo.gl/]  had been taken down which is a shame because it was a\nuseful service, and we wanted to make sure that couldn‚Äôt happen again by using\nthe blockchain.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS? \n\nAuston: IPFS is a project I‚Äôve known about since 2017 that again I thought would\nbe a super awesome way to distribute copies of content on.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nAuston: None really, it was actually super easy for the most part. However I had\nto find a guide that showed me to how to point a domain at the IPFS node.\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nThere were other apps and apis that could make what we did cheaper and faster,\nbut we kept it simple. Also the positive attitude of the judges was really nice\nto have, they were really onboard with the fact that we deployed to main net,\netc. \n\nAny plans to keep working on the project? \n\nWould definitely love to integrate Stripe to make it possible to pay for link\nshortening with a credit/debit card, get more people running a forwarding server\n& perhaps integrate the gas station network to let people pay with BAT or by\nwatching ads.\n\nIn hindsight what‚Äôs something you may have done differently for either the\nproject or the hackathon?\n\nAuston: Jon would have liked to integrate more sponsors, but I‚Äôm actually really\nhappy with the outcome. \n\nAny side projects or interests you would like to shill?\n\nAuston: Definitely quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  as well as 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  - you should try both and run a forwarding server!!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks Jon & Auston for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn\nfrom.
