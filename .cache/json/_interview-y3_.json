Given the ever\npresent challenges related to privacy, database breaches and platform lock-in,\nit's crucial to begin returning data autonomy back to users. \n\nThis post highlights an ETHNewYork [https://ethnewyork.com/]  submission from \nKian Molani [https://twitter.com/KianMolani]  called Y3\n[https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx]: \"a decentralized and\ncensorship-resistant video streaming application that uses Ethereum and IPFS as\nits core technologies.\" ETHNewYork was the first hackathon run in NYC by\nETHglobal, an organisation dedicated to onboarding new Ethereum developers.\nFirst we'll look at how the project works, followed by a few questions FISSION\nasked the team about their background and hackathon experience.\n\nHackathon Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/y3-l8w9mx\n\nRepo: https://github.com/KianMolani/decentralized_video_streaming_app\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow Y3 works\nThe name originated as an aspirational take on where video platforms might head\nin our distributed future. If Youtube (Y2) is a legacy system that can censor\nusers and withhold payments for content, Y3 is an exploration towards a future\nwhere new possibilities open up. Self-hosted, replicated content can't be taken\ndown, and payments over Ethereum are censorship resistant to a high degree.\n\nThe first step for users is to be running or have access to an IPFS node. After\nloading their content into the IPFS interface [https://dist.ipfs.io/#go-ipfs],\nusers submit a content hash to the Y3 onchain Ethereum contract. The video\nmetadata gets stored in a contract array to be accessed later by users.\n\nPayment, if required, would be handled via a Python script, conditional upon\nsuccessful delivery of content from the IPFS network. The contract would then\ncall a function that sets up the transaction. This is one thing that still needs\nto be developed for the project to operate properly. According to Kian,  this\nkind of payment scheme wouldn't be practical in reality: \n\n> Instead, an implementation of either state channels or probabilistic\nmicropayments –with the total time of video content already streamed taken to be\nthe primary metric for payment – would be more apt.\nHLS [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming]  (HTTP Live Streaming)\nand IPNS [https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/ipns/]  (InterPlanetary Naming\nSystem) integrations are also still under development. For now, Y3 can only\nserve static content. IPNS would make those links mutable, and would update the\ncontent address as new chunks of data come in.\n\nOther important libraries used are web3.JS\n[https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/], Infura's API\n[https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/makeRequests.md]  for Ethereum\nintegration, and FFmpeg [https://ffmpeg.org/]  for HLS capable video editing.\n\nIn the future, Kian would like to add a more intuitive frontend. The FISSION\nteam is looking forward to seeing where the project ends up and what functions\nhe can integrate!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here are a few additional questions we had Kian answer about his\nbackground and the hackathon itself:\n\nWhat’s your background as a developer?\n\nI’m currently 21, and so I’m still pursuing my undergrad. As an Engineering\nPhysics major, I’m not left with a lot of time during the semester to develop\nEthereum-related projects, but do develop data processing and machine learning\nsoftware professionally. When I have the time, most of the work that I do in the\ndecentralized space are through hackathons. Thus far, I’ve been to two ETHGlobal\nevents, where the focus of my energy has been to develop two pieces of tech — a\ndecentralized video streaming application and a decentralized computation\napplication.\n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralization initially?\n\nI along with most of my peers had heard of the decentralized space via word of\nmouth - at the time, most of the popular discussion surrounded cryptocurrencies.\nOut of curiosity and a desire to distinguish ourselves from the hype, my\ncolleagues and I decided to look more carefully at the tech behind all these\npopular ideas. Eventually, we came to a point where we were able to judge, for\nourselves, that the technology had real value and a wide selection of practical\nand worth-while use cases. Naturally, this realization lent itself to a\nheightened sense of curiosity and greater exposure to more complex and\ncutting-edge developments in the space.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nFor tech and developer news, I find Twitter to be ideal. In a sense, Twitter is\na very weak filter on ideas, and so when you have a community that is very\nactive on the platform (which is the case for decentralized technologies), the\nresult is a large number of leading figures engaged in discussions on very novel\nconcepts. The downside to this kind of environment is that you’re forced to\njudge for yourself the quality of ideas that have not yet been fully hashed out,\nwhile the upside is that you’re exposed to ideas soon after they’re born.\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nOne of the strong points of this hackathon was that there was a large pool of\nsponsors present there to talk about their products. This made for very fruitful\nand exciting workshops, and along with the large number of high quality hackers\npresent, meant that exposure to new and exciting projects was high.\n\nWhat inspired Y3?\n\nA video steaming application is one of those use cases for decentralized\ntechnologies where the benefits are very obvious to see – you don’t have go\nthrough leaps in logic to explain why it would be useful for people. As a\nplatform, video streaming applications are one of the hallmark luxuries that\nwe’ve been afforded due to the Internet. With them, people are able to share all\nkinds of information in a way that is immediately accessible and highly\nengaging. This luxury, however, isn’t afforded to the billions of people around\nthe world whose governments maintain tight control on Internet transparency.\nThus, the market for this kind of product is huge, and the motivation for the\npursuit of its realization is noble.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS?\n\nIPFS emerged as a natural solution to what I wanted, and that was a way to store\nthe contents of videos on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. As a solution,\nit was fairly elegant – the only major disadvantage being the lack of\npersistence of content on the network. This issue, however, is actively being\naddressed by developers of the protocol.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nConnecting my computer to the IPFS network and integrating the appropriate\nPython client libraries were all very straightforward. By far, the biggest\nchallenge that I encountered was in trying to use IPFS in a way that allowed for\nHLS functionality (HLS is a communications protocol that allows for the bit rate\nof incoming data to vary in accordance with the quality of network\nconnectivity).\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nAfter expressing the difficulty that I encountered in trying to properly\nintegrate IPFS with HLS, I was able to obtain feedback from a gentleman from\nLivepeer (a Platform as a Service used by developers to add videos to their\nprojects). He explained how I could use IPNS (a system used to update links to\nIPFS content) to handle updating a pointer to the hash of the file contents\nperiodically.\n\nAny plans to keep working on the project?\n\nYes. My application does not completely function as intended. I will finish\nproperly implementing HLS functionality and then go on to share the project\nonline.\n\nIn hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the\nproject or the hackathon?\n\nI actually anticipated the issue that I had regarding the implementation of HLS\nfunctionality with IPFS before I even started the project. In hindsight, I\nshould have sought out a solution to my problem well before I ever encountered\nit.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThanks Kian for spending time to help get this post ready for others to learn\nfrom.
