The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an incredibly powerful new protocol that gives every piece of data its own unique address. It’s also more immutable than the way many smart contracts work.</p><p>Boris recently wrote about the <a href=\"https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/ethereum-governance/\">layers of Ethereum Governance</a>, and has a long history of involvement with open source. He will talk about participating in the Ethereum Community, the ETH1x roadmap, and how anyone can learn to contribute to open source communities.</p><p>The theme is Cypherpunk Speakeasy, and there will be xDAI and Burner Wallets. Kurt Barry, a software engineer from MakerDAO, will be giving a primer on DAI, the crypto we will be using for payments.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><style type=\"text/css\">\n#meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix:after { visibility: hidden; display: block; font-size: 0; content: \" \"; clear: both; height: 0; }\n* html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix, *:first-child+html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix { zoom: 1; }\n#meetup_oembed { background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:10px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;margin:0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; }\n#meetup_oembed h3 { font-weight:normal; margin:0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:26px; font-family:Georgia,Palatino,serif; font-size:24px }\n#meetup_oembed p { margin: 0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:16px; }\n#meetup_oembed img { border:none; margin:0; padding:0; }\n#meetup_oembed a, #meetup_oembed a:visited, #meetup_oembed a:link { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: none; cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; }\n#meetup_oembed a:hover { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: underline; }\n#meetup_oembed a.mu_button { font-size:14px; -moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;border:2px solid #A7241D;color:white!important;text-decoration:none;background-color: #CA3E47; background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ca3e47, #a8252e); background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top, color-stop(0, #a8252e), color-stop(1, #ca3e47));disvplay:inline-block;padding:5px 10px; }\n#meetup_oembed a.mu_button:hover { color: #fff!important; text-decoration: none; }\n#meetup_oembed .photo { width:50px; height:50px; overflow:hidden;background:#ccc;float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;text-align:center;padding:1px; }\n#meetup_oembed .photo img { height:50px }\n#meetup_oembed .number { font-size:18px; }\n#meetup_oembed .thing { text-transform: uppercase; color: #555; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"meetup_oembed\" style=\"height:418px\">\n     <div style=\"max-height:378px;overflow:hidden\">\n          <h3>Seattle Ethereum's First Cypherpunk Speakeasy!</h3>\n          <p style=\"margin:5px 0;font-size:16px\">Tuesday, May 28, 2019,  6:30 PM</p>\n          <p style=\"margin: 0 0 5px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Ada's Lab</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">425 15th Avenue E Seattle, wa</span></p>\n\n          <span style=\"color:#4F8A10;font-size:16px;\">42 Ethers Attending</span> \n          <div style=\"margin:5px 0 10px\" class=\"mu_clearfix\">\n               <div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/7/2/b/thumb_271250987.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/a/d/3/thumb_276767827.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/8/f/a/thumb_275950490.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/3/9/8/thumb_282257304.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/1/3/8/thumb_285537656.jpeg\"></div>\n          </div>\n          <p style=\"line-height:16px\">Get ready - it's Seattle's first Cypherpunk Speakeasy!
