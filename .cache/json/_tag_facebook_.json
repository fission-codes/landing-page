I decided to export\nmy photos and videos and put them up on Fission.\n\nFor now, this is a manual process and involves some command line usage. I'll\nwrite this up as an App Idea in our forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/app-ideas]  and see if we can spend some time\nmaking this \"one-click\".\n\n> Please make that one click for me dude\n\nâ€” Jamie Burke (@jamie247) November 9, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/jamie247/status/1193083841826770944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nRead the Facebook help article on Accessing & Downloading Your Information\n[https://www.facebook.com/help/1701730696756992/]  for instructions on how to\nnavigate to the right section of your Facebook account.\n\nOn a desktop browser, it should be under the triangle in the upper right hand\ncorner, then Settings, then Your Facebook Information, then Download Your\nInformation.\n\nI don't upload much to Facebook and only cross-post my Instagram photos (which\nare cross-posted to my personal blog), so I clicked Deselect All  (says Select\nAll  in the screenshot above), and only selected Photos and Videos. I also set\nMedia Quality to \"High\" (although some people still report that these are still\nnot as large as the originals, which may only be accessible through the API).\n\nYou can experiment with including other items. But, be aware that because there\naren't any permissions, you may be sharing information you don't want to if you\npublish the files. Same goes for the photos. I have posted most things on\nFacebook the assumption that they are \"public\".\n\nClick the Create File  button and go make a coffee. Facebook will notify when\nyour download is ready.\n\nJust over 13 years of Facebook.To download, you'll need to click on the Download  button and enter your\nFacebook password. You now have a zip file with browse-able HTML files and your\nphoto and video files.\n\nPutting your files online with Fission\nYou'll need to type a few commands into the command line Terminal on your\nmachine, but everything should just work if you copy-paste.\n\nInstall the IPFS Desktop [https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop#install] \n and run it. You've got a graphical interface to explore your local IPFS server,\nwhich is running in the background.\n\nOn Mac, make sure you've got homebrew installed [https://brew.sh], then open the\nTerminal app and install the Fission tools using these commands:\n\nbrew tap fission-suite/fission\nbrew install fission-cli\n\nYou can find extended installation instructions in our Fission Guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes/installation], and I expect our friends running\nLinux will have no problem.\n\nNow, you're going to register for Fission.\n\nfission register\n\nYour username will be your subdomain, e.g. boris.fission.name. Pick a password\nand enter an email address. We are adding support for custom domain names, stay\ntuned!\n\nNow, you've got a zip file in your Downloads folder from Facebook, called\nsomething like \"facebook-YOURNAME.zip\". Unzip it and you'll have a\n\"facebook-YOURNAME\" folder.\n\nBack to the terminal! This is the last step!\n\nThe fission up  command is going to add all your files to IPFS, through your\nlocal IPFS Desktop. Then, Fission's server will get sent the hash that\nrepresents the folder, we'll use IPFS to keep a copy of all your files, and\nupdate DNS of your subdomain.\n\nThe following command will be correct if you're on a Mac and downloaded to the\nstandard downloads folder. Otherwise, just enter the path to where the unzipped\nFacebook folder is:\n\nfission up ~/Downloads/facebook-YOURNAME/\n\nI only had about 200MB of files, so this happened pretty quickly. Visit\nYOURNAME.fission.name in your browser and you should see something like this:\n\nYour Facebook photos are online and browse-able! You can see mine at \nboris.fission.name/Photos/facebook [https://boris.fission.name/Photos/facebook/] \n (I put mine in a subfolder, because I already host a bunch of public files on\nmy Fission site).\n\nTechnically the files are being served directly from your computer, when you're\nonline and have IPFS Desktop running. The Fission service is also serving those\nfiles, and stays online when you're offline. As a next step, you can explore\ninstalling the IPFS Companion browser extension\n[https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion]  which will access IPFS\ncontent natively.\n\nJoin us in our Discord chat forum [https://fission.codes/discord]  if you have\nquestions or just come say \"hi\"!","html":"<p>Facebook has a fairly extensive data export system built in.
