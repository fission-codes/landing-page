The first one is\nwith the Ghost Content Management System (CMS). We use Ghost to run this blog\nand want to start using it to integrate with and power our home page, so it's a\ngreat place for us to start.\n\nThe basic pattern of \"Headless\" is that your authors and editors login to a\nserver based system with all the authoring and editing tools they are used to,\nbut then the \"head\" – the usual template system and user facing website – isn't\nused. Instead, a modern front end framework is custom designed and built to take\nthe published content of the CMS and host it. This fits great with the Fission\napp publishing platform.\n\nAfter we've got the basics of a headless publishing workflow setup with Fission,\nwe'll move on to using our Webnative framework to add personalization at the\nedge, but that will come in later posts.\n\nAside from Ghost, we're also looking at Headless WordPress\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-wordpress/1448]  and Headless Drupal\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-drupal/1513]. Let us know in the forum if\nyou've got other Headless projects that you'd like to combine with Fission!\n\nBuild a Next.js Blog powered by Headless Ghost and Fission\nFollow the tutorial below to get started with your own Headless Ghost, or visit\nit on Github for the README version\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost].\n\nYou want to have a modern static website/app built with React, deployed to a CDN\n(even a distributed [https://ipfs.io/]  one), and loading super fast for\nvisitors and search engines.\n\nYou want to avoid the headaches and costs of managing and securing servers for\ntraditional content management systems (CMSs) like Ghost and WordPress.\n\nThat's what static site generators (like Next.js, Gatsby, and others\n[https://staticgen.com/]) are for, right?\n\nBut,  you don't  want to have to retrain  every writer and content creator on\nyour team to use Markdown  and Git. Ghost and WordPress are familiar, pretty,\nand usable. They have been iterated over years to be approachable by almost\nanyone.\n\nWhat do you do? That's right you cut the CMS' head off 🔪\n\nMore politely, you decouple  the interface used for authoring  content from the\nsystems used for rendering  and distributing  it.\n\nWith CMS and website decoupled, you can protect the CMS inside an intranet\nwithout exposing it to outside danger, or even use it as a desktop word\nprocessor running only on your machine, as I'll show you in this tutorial.\n\nTo make things easier we've made a template Next.js website that connects to\nGhost and pulls content from it. Follow along and try it out.

It's a purely additive change.\n\nThere's also a GitHub Action to build and publish the static website to Fission.\nIt works automatically on pushes to the git repo, and can be triggered manually\nafter updating the content on Ghost. (The default Ghost webhook isn't\ncustomizable to trigger a GitHub Action, but that can be added as a plugin.)\n\nThe Markdown blog posts are stored in /_posts  as files with frontmatter\nsupport. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.\n\nThe Ghost blog posts are fetched using Ghost's Content API library.\n\n✨  Getting Started\nLet's start by making this starter yours:\n\n * Click Use this template  at the starter page on GitHub\n   [https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost]\n   \n   That will make a copy of the starter into a new repo under your account with\n   a fresh git history. You can pick a different name for it too; in that case\n   replace nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost  with your chosen name below.\n   \n   \n * Clone the repo (replace with your own URL):\n   \n   git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost.git\n   \n   \n   \n * cd into the repo:\n   \n   cd nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost\n   \n   \n   \n * Install dependencies\n   \n   yarn\n   \n   \n   \n\nAll command-line instructions and directory paths from now on assume the current\ndirectory is the root of the cloned repo.\n\n👻  Setting Up Ghost\nPublic or Local Ghost?\nRunning a local Ghost instance is good for testing. But also, if you have no\nneed for a Ghost instance running all the time out on the internet (for example,\nif you are the only author) you can do this for your production website, using\nGhost locally for its nice interface if you prefer that to editing Markdown\nfiles. No servers to secure, no bills to pay.\n\nSetting Up Local Ghost\nIf you have a Ghost instance running already somewhere, move on to the next\nstep. If you don't, you can set one up on your own machine with Docker.\n\nTo create a local Ghost instance with Docker, run the following at the root of\nyour repo:\n\nyarn ghost-local-create\n\n\nGhost data will be stored at ./ghost, which is in .gitignore  by default. In a \nprivate  repo you can choose to commit that too and have your Ghost content\nversioned and available whenever you need it.\n\nThere are other scripts like ghost-local-start, ghost-local-stop, and \nghost-local-remove  which you might find handy to manage the Docker container.\n\nAfter Docker downloads and sets up Ghost, it will be accessible on your browser\nat http://localhost:3001.\n\nNext you need to create an admin account on your newly-created Ghost. To do\nthat, visit the admin interface at http://localhost:3001/ghost  and follow the\nwizard.\n\nExposing the Ghost Content API\nI'll use http://localhost:3001  for the examples, but you can replace that with\nyour Ghost URL if you have an instance already running somewhere else.\n\n * Go to the admin interface at http://localhost:3001/ghost\n * On the left-hand sidebar, click on \"Integrations\"\n * On the Integrations screen, click on +Add custom integration\n   [http://localhost:3001/ghost/#/settings/integrations/new/]\n * Give it a name, like nextjs, and click \"Create\" then \"Save\"\n\nNow the important part:\n\n * On the same screen, you'll find two fields we need: Content API Key  and API\n   URL\n * Copy those into a new .env.local  file, like this:\n\n# .env.local\n# replace values with your own\nGHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001\nGHOST_API_KEY=2a9356e4a5214c883ba886e58e\n\n\n⚠️ This file is ignored by git by default. Don't  commit env.local  to git\nunless you know what you're doing.\n\nAlright! Ghost part's done.\n\n💻  Running Next.js Locally\nNext.js is the missing static website head  to our headless Ghost. Let's stitch\nthem together! This should be enough:\n\nyarn dev\n\n\nYour blog should be up and running at http://localhost:3000! (If anything\nunexpected happens, please post an issue\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost/issues/new]\n.)\n\nNow you can change the Next.js website code and the content on Ghost, and\niterate quickly on them in the browser.\n\nNote: live-reload works for Next.js code and Markdown files; to see changes to\nGhost content you need to refresh the page.\n\n🌐  Deploying to Fission\nWhen you're ready to publish, the first step is exporting your website to a set\nof static files:\n\nyarn build\n\n\nThat should create a directory at ./out  with all your ready-to-publish files.\n\nNext we use the Fission CLI to send that out onto the internets.\n\n🔰  Fission CLI Install and Sign Up\nTo install the Fission command-line interface using brew, run:\n\nbrew tap fission-suite/fission\nbrew install fission-cli\n\n\nFor more ways of installing the Fission CLI, please check the documentation\n[https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation].\n\nIf you don't have a Fission account, you can create one without leaving the\ncommand-line by running:\n\nfission setup\n\n\n🌱  Register New Fission App\nYou can pick a subdomain or let Fission choose a random one for you.\n\nTo host the Next.js website at a random subdomain on .fission.app, run:\n\nfission app register\n\n\nTo choose your own subdomain, use the --name  option like this:\n\nfission app register --name my-beautiful-subdomain\n\n\nThat will create a fission.yaml  file. This one is safe to commit to git, and\nyou should  do that if you want to use the GitHub Action to build and deploy the\nwebsite for you. Make sure there is a line saying build: ./out  in it. That's\nthe directory where Next.js puts the exported website files.\n\n🚀   Aand... Launch!\nOne last step:\n\nfission app publish\n\n\nAnd you're done! Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by\nthe Fission CLI or at my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app  if you used the --name \n option. Yay!\n\n🤖  (Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action\nIf you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you\nmake a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter\ncomes with a GitHub Action that automates that for you.\n\nTo get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to\nthe \"Settings\" > \"Secrets\"  screen on your GitHub repo, then create a \"New\nrepository secret\"  for each of these:\n\n * GHOST_API_URL\n * GHOST_API_KEY\n * FISSION_KEY\n\nThe values for the GHOST_API_  fields are the same ones you used for the \n.env.local  file above.\n\nThe FISSION_KEY  was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when\nyou set it up. Here's how you get it:\n\ncat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64\n\n\nWith all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the deploy  action manually by\nclicking on \"Run workflow\" > \"Run workflow\", or see it in action after your next\n git push.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n\n⚠️  To fetch the content from Ghost, the GitHub Action must be able to access\nthe URL  entered in the GHOST_API_URL  secret.\n\nIf you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, http://localhost:3001 \n won't be visible to the outside.\n\nA simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL\nis by using one of the open source alternatives to ngrok\n[https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling]  or ngrok\n[https://ngrok.com/]  itself.\n\nWith ngrok you do something like this:\n\nngrok http 3001\n\n\n⚠️  This is great for testing, but not secure. Look into using https  if you're\ngoing to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> Why \"(semi-)\" automatic then? 🤔\n\n\nGlad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo\nbecause there's a built-in \"on push\" event  that can be used to trigger  it.\n\nBut when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs\na way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no git\npush  event happening, so the trigger is usually a webhook\n[https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event] \n (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)\n\n🙂  Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content\nchanges happen.\n\n🙃Unluckily, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in\nthe webhook requests it sends, and GitHub requires  a certain field to be\npresent telling it which ref  (usually a branch) you are referring to.\n\nBottom line: after changing things on Ghost, you need to trigger a build\nmanually.\n\nYou can do that via the GitHub interface (\"Actions\" > \"Continuous Deployment\" >\n\"Run workflow\" > \"Run workflow\"), or by running the handy script  we added to\nthis starter:\n\nGITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh\n\n\nHere's how you can get an auth token\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token]\n.\n\nThis situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins,\nbut we wanted to stick to the basic install.\n\n🙏  Show your support\nPlease give a  ⭐️\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost]  if you\nliked this project!

Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by the Fission CLI or at <code>my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app</code> if you used the <code>--name</code> option. Yay!</p>\n<h4 id=\"semiautomaticdeploymentwiththegithubaction\">🤖  (Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action</h4>\n<p>If you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you make a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter comes with <strong>a GitHub Action that automates that for you</strong>.</p>\n<p>To get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to the <strong>&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Secrets&quot;</strong> screen on your GitHub repo, then create a <strong>&quot;New repository secret&quot;</strong> for each of these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>GHOST_API_URL</code></li>\n<li><code>GHOST_API_KEY</code></li>\n<li><code>FISSION_KEY</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The values for the <code>GHOST_API_</code> fields are the same ones you used for the <code>.env.local</code> file above.</p>\n<p>The <code>FISSION_KEY</code> was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when you set it up. Here's how you get it:</p>\n<pre><code>cat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64\n</code></pre>\n<p>With all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the <code>deploy</code> action manually by clicking on <strong>&quot;Run workflow&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot;</strong>, or see it in action after your next <code>git push</code>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<p>⚠️  To fetch the content from Ghost, <strong>the GitHub Action must be able to access the URL</strong> entered in the <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> secret.</p>\n<p>If you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, <code>http://localhost:3001</code> won't be visible to the outside.</p>\n<p>A simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL is by using one of the <a href=\"https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling\">open source alternatives to ngrok</a> or <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">ngrok</a> itself.</p>\n<p>With ngrok you do something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>ngrok http 3001\n</code></pre>\n<p>⚠️  This is great for testing, but <strong>not secure</strong>. Look into using <code>https</code> if you're going to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.</p>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why <strong>&quot;(semi-)</strong>&quot; automatic then? 🤔</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Glad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo because <strong>there's a built-in &quot;on push&quot; event</strong> that can be used to <strong>trigger</strong> it.</p>\n<p>But when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs a way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no <code>git push</code> event happening, so the trigger is usually a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event\"><strong>webhook</strong></a> (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)</p>\n<p>🙂  Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content changes happen.</p>\n<p>🙃  <strong><em>Un</em>luckily</strong>, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in the webhook requests it sends, and GitHub <strong>requires</strong> a certain field to be present telling it which <code>ref</code> (usually a branch) you are referring to.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: <strong>after changing things <em>on Ghost</em>, you need to trigger a build manually</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can do that via the GitHub interface (&quot;Actions&quot; &gt; &quot;Continuous Deployment&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot; &gt; &quot;Run workflow&quot;), or by <strong>running the handy script</strong> we added to this starter:</p>\n<pre><code>GITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here's how you can get an <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token\">auth token</a>.</p>\n<p>This situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins, but we wanted to stick to the basic install.</p>\n<h2 id=\"showyoursupport\">🙏  Show your support</h2>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost\">give a  ⭐️</a>  if you liked this project!
