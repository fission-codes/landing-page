Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost?\nFor small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair\nto say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with\nsocial media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what\nis the hidden cost to you? \n\nIf you have seen The Social Dilemma [https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/]  then\nyou might be familiar with this quote:\n“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel\nHövermann\n\nThe hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from\ncollecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your\nclicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases\nis your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.\n\nHere’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported\nproducts, ads are presented to you.  These advertisements are curated based on\ncookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit\nwithin the app itself.\n\nLet’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a\n“post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an\nimpression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming\ninto your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment\nfor your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar\ngiven what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant\nin our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7\nout of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first\nglance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and\nmonitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those\nwho work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.\n\nUsing ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are\ncollecting information about you. This information is collected via your\nbehaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to\ninfer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to\nwhere you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available\nsimply from behaviours you exhibit online. \n\nAt Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very\nreason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal\nrates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. \n\nWhat happens when you pay for your app:\n\n 1. Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical\n    and humane technological future.\n 2. Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.\n 3. Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application\n    you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal\n    information for targeted advertisements.\n 4. Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers\n    outside of North America and Western Europe.\n    a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of \t\t\n       500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a\n    \t\t    $25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an \t\t\t\t\n           independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in\n    developing \t    countries\n 5. Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers,\n    “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something,\n    the more they value it.”\n 6. Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data\n    for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.\n\nLet’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on\nthe street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high\nschool, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online\nevery day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and\ngames. Sounds insane right? \n\nThe future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to\nproliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of\nmany is to pay for the applications and software you use. \n\nAt Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and\nprivacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our\nmission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to\nbe part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving\ndevelopers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to\neasily charge for them.\n\nFor end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging\ninto Fission’s Drive app [https://drive.fission.codes]. It’s free for small\namounts of data, and you can pay for a premium account on Open Collective\n[https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive], which helps us build more apps and\ntools for developers.\n\nFor developers, check out some of the App ideas in the forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none], or start with the dev guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes]  to build an app of your own.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Social Dilemma.
