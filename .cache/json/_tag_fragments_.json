He reminds teams to use \"end of week\nreviews\" as a way to support both each other and collective culture. Read more\non Friday wins and a case study in ritual design\n[https://kellanem.com/notes/friday-wins]\n\n> Culture is what you celebrate. Rituals are the tools you use to shape culture.\nYet very few of us think much about ritual design. \n> A standard piece of software development practice that many teams let lapse, or\nmerely let lapse into being sub-optimal is “Friday wins”, sometimes called\nsprint demos or sprint reviews. But you can take what can be a flaccid and\nrepetitive meeting and make it a valuable ritual by grounding it in values.\nGo-IPFS contributors have crafted a new release: go-ipfs 0.4.21\n[https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/releases/tag/v0.4.21]\n\nA short but useful blog from Drew DeVault titled: What is a fork, really, and\nhow GitHub changed its meaning\n[https://drewdevault.com/2019/05/24/What-is-a-fork.html]. His take is that\npersonal branches that push to core repositories are what GitHub mislabels as\nforks, with the intention to lock projects onto their \"cathedral\" platform.\nSemantics are important!\n\n> The fork button on GitHub - with the little number next to it for depositing\ndopamine into your brain - is a bit misleading. GitHub co-opted the meaning of\n“fork” to trick you into participating in their platform more. They did this in\na well-intentioned way, for the sake of their pull requests feature, but\nultimately this design is self-serving and causes some friction when\ncontributors venture out of their GitHub sandbox and into the rest of the\nsoftware development ecosystem.

We're not quite as radical about local-first, but we are definitely aligned around the ideals for software and data they describe:</p><blockquote>In this article we propose “local-first software”: a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration <em><em>and</em></em> ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data.</blockquote><p>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infominer33\">@infominer33</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/projectpages/project-pages\">Project Pages</a>, a Jekyll Template geared towards collaborative science, with support for Matlab, Jupyter Notebooks, and other charting, graphing, and data visualization tools.

They recognize that Slack is not suitable for meaningful conversations, so they automatically delete chat messages older than a few weeks to discourage relying on it for long-term archival. In retrospectives, team members often reflect on whether they chose the right medium (email, chat, or forum) for various conversations.</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/OyetokeT\">Oyetoke Toby @OyetokeT</a> writes up <a href=\"https://dev.to/oyetoket/how-i-deployed-codesandbox-apps-to-heroku-ndo\">forking Codesandbox so you can deploy to Heroku</a>.
