The TiddlyWiki launcher that\nwe’re working on with Jeremy can include any community Editions that people want\nto include, and we’ll be opening up the Github repo shortly for that.\n\nAnd if you’re a creator that wants to build a business around a TiddlyWiki\nEdition on Fission, with your own supported app that 100s or 1000s of users can\nlaunch with a click and have their own custom domain, we’d love to talk. Our\nupcoming App Cloning feature is designed for this, and we’ll showcase this\nability in the community-supported TiddlyWiki on Fission app so that you can see\nhow it works.\n\nWe’re totally inspired by the TiddlyWiki community, and want to see what else we\ncan build together.
