We've been made obsolete and I don't mean\nour jobs, I mean ourselves.\n\nI'm often on planes lately. Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I read or write code,\nother times I watch an entire season before a decent has begun. I always get\nfrom one destination to the next. Typically I'm the same person from take off to\nlanding. Today however, I'm not.\n\nI was coming back from speaking at The Big Elixir\n[https://www.thebigelixir.com/]  and chewing on a set of conversations I had.\nOne in particular:\n\n> Did you know that you can move people to buy more Pizza just by showing them a\ncertain shade of blue? No no I don't mean blue in the advertisement, I mean blue\nin general, like funny meme or a cute picture.*\n*While I can't cite a conversation, I can cite a few resources that point in\nthis direction. Please read this all and take whatever I'm saying with a grain\nof salt.\n\nThe conversation was wide ranging, interesting, and terrifying. Terrifying for\nthe present and frightening for the future. It was in reference to A/B testing,\nat scale, with teams of psychologists and statisticians\n[https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/22/the-7-creep-factors-of-online-behavioral-advertising/]\n. Something that's happening right now. And not just at ad agencies. But at\ngovernment agencies (as we all know\n[https://www.wired.com/story/russias-disinformation-war-is-just-getting-started/]\n).\n\nWell-resourced entities working to exploit our own internal systems and\ninvisibly guide our behavior. In ways that aren't obvious or intuitive. Like\nseeing a colour more often makes you susceptible to a type of food branding much\nlater.\n\nThese changes are small and subtle. But when layered together can be tectonic in\nshaping your own personal \"opinions\", \"behaviors\", \"actions\" and \"emotions\n[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds]\n\".\n\nWhat are we if we're not dictating our own thoughts and outcomes? The saying is\n\"I think therefore I am\". Should it now be \"I'm statistically significant\ntherefore I'm not\"?\n\nThe concept of this type of manipulation is not new. Yet, like most problems\nlately, It's the scale and efficiency that is concerning. The more your life\nthat exists online, the more that is tested. The more that is influenced. The\nmore autonomy that you loose. The more your body and your actions are not your\nown. We have to ask then: What world is this setting us up for?\n\nOur world is already headed towards a dominant superpower not afraid to\nsuppress\nthoughts and people\n[https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/20/20813660/china-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-protests-social-media]\n. With many state actors manipulating your opinions. Trying to change the\noutcomes of elections\n[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump]\n. Creating division and mistrust.\n[https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html]\n\nIt beckons back to the chilling effect. An observation after the Snowden\npapers,\nshowing people are less likely to search innocent terms if their government may\ndisapprove.\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/new-study-snowdens-disclosures-about-nsa-spying-had-a-scary-effect-on-free-speech/] \n This effectively controls your thoughts. This next level of manipulation,\nthrough mass experimentation is just skipping a step. Making sure you never\nthink of the topic at all.\n\nIn the future I do want children but I'm already concerned at the world we're\nleaving them with.

We've been made obsolete and I don't mean our jobs, I mean ourselves.</strong></p><p>I'm often on planes lately. Sometimes I sleep, sometimes I read or write code, other times I watch an entire season before a decent has begun. I always get from one destination to the next. Typically I'm the same person from take off to landing. Today however, I'm not.</p><p>I was coming back from speaking at <a href=\"https://www.thebigelixir.com/\">The Big Elixir</a> and chewing on a set of conversations I had. One in particular:</p><blockquote>Did you know that you can move people to buy more Pizza just by showing them a certain shade of blue? No no I don't mean blue in the advertisement, I mean blue in general, like funny meme or a cute picture.*</blockquote><p><em>*While I can't cite a conversation, I can cite a few resources that point in this direction. Please read this all and take whatever I'm saying with a grain of salt.</em></p><p>The conversation was wide ranging, interesting, and terrifying. Terrifying for the present and frightening for the future. It was in reference to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/22/the-7-creep-factors-of-online-behavioral-advertising/\">A/B testing, at scale, with teams of psychologists and statisticians</a>. Something that's happening right now. And not just at ad agencies. But at government agencies (<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/russias-disinformation-war-is-just-getting-started/\">as we all know</a>).</p><p>Well-resourced entities working to exploit our own internal systems and invisibly guide our behavior. In ways that aren't obvious or intuitive. Like seeing a colour more often makes you susceptible to a type of food branding much later.</p><p>These changes are small and subtle. But when layered together can be tectonic in shaping your own personal \"opinions\", \"behaviors\", \"actions\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds\">emotions</a>\".</p><p>What are we if we're not dictating our own thoughts and outcomes? The saying is \"I think therefore I am\". Should it now be <strong>\"I'm statistically significant therefore I'm not\"</strong>?</p><p>The concept of this type of manipulation is not new. Yet, like most problems lately, It's the scale and efficiency that is concerning. The more your life that exists online, the more that is tested. The more that is influenced. The more autonomy that you loose. The more your body and your actions are not your own. We have to ask then: What world is this setting us up for?</p><p>Our world is already headed towards a dominant superpower <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/20/20813660/china-facebook-twitter-hong-kong-protests-social-media\">not afraid to suppress thoughts and people</a>. With many state actors manipulating your opinions. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/01/how-russia-helped-to-swing-the-election-for-trump\">Trying to change the outcomes of elections</a>. <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html\">Creating division and mistrust.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/27/new-study-snowdens-disclosures-about-nsa-spying-had-a-scary-effect-on-free-speech/\">It beckons back to the chilling effect. An observation after the Snowden papers, showing people are less likely to search innocent terms if their government may disapprove.</a> This effectively controls your thoughts.
