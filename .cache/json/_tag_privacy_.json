Who doesn’t love something that comes with no cost?\nFor small businesses, hobbyists, startups and everyday people, I think it’s fair\nto say we all get excited when we hear this. In fact, in a world filled with\nsocial media, apps and games on our phones, perhaps we even expect it--but what\nis the hidden cost to you? \n\nIf you have seen The Social Dilemma [https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/]  then\nyou might be familiar with this quote:\n“If you’re not paying for the product, then you are the product” — Daniel\nHövermann\n\nThe hard fact here is that these “free” apps (ad-supported products) profit from\ncollecting your data. They also make money from your attention through your\nclicks, likes and screen time. The real product for sale in all of these cases\nis your attention and subsequent interactions while logged in.\n\nHere’s a simple example of how you become the product: In advertising-supported\nproducts, ads are presented to you.  These advertisements are curated based on\ncookies you agree to in your web browser as well as other behaviours you exhibit\nwithin the app itself.\n\nLet’s break this down a bit more. You’re scrolling Facebook when you see a\n“post” for something you were recently shopping for online. This is called an\nimpression and the app/platform gets paid by the advertiser simply for it coming\ninto your view. Now say you click on that ad. Facebook receives another payment\nfor your behaviour, in this instance for your click. This might sound familiar\ngiven what we all know about Facebook, but this kind of advertising is rampant\nin our world. A recent article from the website MLSDev states that currently, “7\nout of 10 apps contain embedded advertisements”. This seems innocent at first\nglance, but who can advertise on these platforms is largely unregulated and\nmonitored primarily by algorithms. Algorithms that many people--including those\nwho work at these companies-- don’t completely understand.\n\nUsing ads to provide free apps for users means that these companies are\ncollecting information about you. This information is collected via your\nbehaviour, views, and interactions. Then, this harvested information is used to\ninfer demographic information about you. This includes but is not limited to\nwhere you live, your age, if you have kids etc. All of this is made available\nsimply from behaviours you exhibit online. \n\nAt Fission, we are on a mission to normalize the payment of apps for this very\nreason and believe that a movement towards paying for apps, even at nominal\nrates, would bring about greater protection for you, the user. \n\nWhat happens when you pay for your app:\n\n 1. Your data becomes more secure and we begin to move towards a more ethical\n    and humane technological future.\n 2. Your behaviour and attention are not propagated and sold.\n 3. Your privacy is more protected because the profitability of the application\n    you are using is not contingent on your screen time/attention and personal\n    information for targeted advertisements.\n 4. Charging for apps can improve the standard of living for app developers\n    outside of North America and Western Europe.\n    a. Example: You publish an app and promote it, developing a user base of \t\t\n       500 users. If those 500 users pay $50 for that app, we’re talking about a\n    \t\t    $25,000 USD salary for that developer. Pretty substantial for an \t\t\t\t\n           independent developer in most parts of the world, especially in\n    developing \t    countries\n 5. Payment places value on the work. In an article from Derek Sivers,\n    “Psychology experiments have shown that the more people pay for something,\n    the more they value it.”\n 6. Developers should be paid ethically without distributing their user’s data\n    for financial gain to largely unregulated advertisers.\n\nLet’s think about this. Would you be comfortable telling a stranger you met on\nthe street, where you live, how many kids you have, where you went to high\nschool, if you’re married or not? We readily volunteer this information online\nevery day using ad-supported apps, like social media, productivity apps and\ngames. Sounds insane right? \n\nThe future is not as abysmal as it might seem. While technology is bound to\nproliferate there are ways to prevent this dark picture above. The first step of\nmany is to pay for the applications and software you use. \n\nAt Fission this is a driving focus for us. We believe in the protection and\nprivacy of our users is essential--That’s why we feel so strongly about our\nmission. By supporting a movement for normalizing the payment of apps, we aim to\nbe part of the solution. We encrypt the data of every end-user--while giving\ndevelopers the tools to build great apps, and eventually include the ability to\neasily charge for them.\n\nFor end-users wanting to try out some of these apps, you can start by logging\ninto Fission’s Drive app [https://drive.fission.codes]. It’s free for small\namounts of data, and you can pay for a premium account on Open Collective\n[https://opencollective.com/fissiondrive], which helps us build more apps and\ntools for developers.\n\nFor developers, check out some of the App ideas in the forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/11/none], or start with the dev guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes]  to build an app of your own.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Social Dilemma.

When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into\ntheir data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:\n\n 1. We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers,\n    called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)\n 2. Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted\n    and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and\n    can’t see your content.\n 3. We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as\n    possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few\n    third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.\n\n> Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.\nAt Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built\ninto modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a\nprivate encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.\n\nBy the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default Fission\nDrive app [https://drive.fission.codes]  and create a new Fission account.\nNotice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it\ndoesn’t ask you for a password.\n\nTo use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or\nphone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to\nanother device that already has permission.\n\nNow, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have\npermission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all\nwithout setting up or having to remember a password.\n\nApple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps\neveryone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking\nthe same approach.\n\nWhat about lost devices?\nBut what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the\nencrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now,\nthe answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API\nbuilt into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for\nsecurity reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover\nyour encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.\n\nOne of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of\ndefault use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do\nrely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards\nbased on the real world support available in all major browsers, including\nmobile browsers.\n\nUsing a single-device as a base case\nLet’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile\ncomputing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that\none mobile device means you’ve lost everything.\n\nThis is the common base case we need to keep in mind.\n\nIt’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is\nmuch easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop\ndevice. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around\nfor a really long time.\n\nIn fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the \nprivate key they used to securely connect to GitHub\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh] \n was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of\nowning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!\n\nBut since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to\nplan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system\naccessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.\n\nSplitting up keys\nOur basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces.\nWe then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user\naccount.\n\nThe other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.\n\nWhen the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it\ncreates the complete key that can access the person’s account.\n\nBecause of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.\n\n> If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret\nkeys to leak.\nWhere should I store recovery codes?\nOn Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating\nsystem — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included.\nWe’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their\nSafari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.\n\nOn Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google\nservices built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to\nusing iCloud in our iOS example.\n\nAdvanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in\nApple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password\naccount, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.\n\nSignal's Note to Self feature\n[https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self]And in\nthe future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious\nusers to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage\nbackup keys.\n\nGet involved\nYou can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our Account Recovery\ndesign process [https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432]  in the\nforum.\n\nWe’re not done with our design. We are still working at the level of security,\nsystems, and cryptographic principles, as well as streamlining the user\nexperience and the flows for users.\n\nThe code is being developed out in the open in the Dashboard code repository\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard]. We welcome questions, suggestions,\nand contributions – drop by our Discord chat [https://fission.codes/discord].","html":"<p>At first glance, account recovery might seem like a simple topic: just write a reset password function, send a challenge code, and you're done!</p><p>But, Fission’s commitment to prioritizing user control makes things a little more complicated.

The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around for a really long time.</p><p>In fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh\">private key they used to securely connect to GitHub</a> was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of owning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!</p><p>But since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to plan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system accessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.</p><h2 id=\"splitting-up-keys\"><strong>Splitting up keys</strong></h2><p>Our basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces. We then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user account.</p><p>The other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.</p><p>When the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it creates the complete key that can access the person’s account.</p><p>Because of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.</p><blockquote><strong>If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret keys to leak.</strong></blockquote><h2 id=\"where-should-i-store-recovery-codes\"><strong>Where should I store recovery codes?</strong></h2><p>On Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating system — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included. We’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their Safari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.</p><p>On Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google services built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to using iCloud in our iOS example.</p><p>Advanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in Apple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password account, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"https://s3.fission.codes/2021/02/signal_note_to_self.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"><figcaption>Signal's <a href=\"https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self\">Note to Self feature</a></figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And in the future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious users to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage backup keys.</p><h2 id=\"get-involved\"><strong>Get involved</strong></h2><p>You can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our <a href=\"https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432\">Account Recovery design process</a> in the forum.</p><p>We’re not done with our design.
