First we'll look at how the project works,\nfollowed by a few questions FISSION asked the team about their background.\n\nHackathon Devpost: https://devpost.com/software/0xsu-ethereum-short-urls\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/du4e\n\nHow 0xSU works\n\"Think of it like goo.gl except it can't be taken down.\" In theory, URL\nshorteners could censor a link or decline to continue forwarding requests. By\ndeploying to the public Ethereum chain, creating open source proxy servers and\nutilising a distributed storage layer like IPFS, much of that risk is avoided. \n\nBefore using 0xSU, users need to make sure they have either a traditional\nweb-browser like Chrome plus wallet extension (ie Metamask\n[https://metamask.io/]) or through a Web3 browser like Status\n[https://status.im/]  or Coinbase Wallet [https://wallet.coinbase.com/]. If\nthat's ready, they can navigate to 0xSU.co [https://0xsu.co/]  with the URL they\nwant to shorten and store immutably. The web3 frontend is hosted through IPFS,\nmeaning everything needed to make this work properly already exists outside of a\ncentralised server. Currently, the node is hosted through Digital Ocean.\n\nOnce on the site, users submit the link along with a small amount of Ether to\ncover associated gas costs. Under the hood, the link is written into the\ncontract (address on Etherscan\n[https://etherscan.io/address/0x19624ffa41fe26744e74fdbba77bef967a222d4c]) as a\nkey value pair: the full link and the shortened one. The backend sits onchain in\nthe contract, accessed via either a helper js library\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-js-lib]  or one of the open source 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  proxy servers: flask\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-flask-server], sinatra\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-sinatra-server], or express\n[https://github.com/dU4E/0xsu-express-server].\n\nAdditionally, the url shortener doesn't work without an http redirect, so they\nwrote open source forwarding proxies that enable this and anyone can run. The\nproject currently uses Quiknode [https://quiknode.io/]  as the Web3 provider to\nsupply a node that the forwarders can hook into.\n\nGiven that the code is open source, anyone could fork the front end and run\ntheir own forwarding instance. In the future, users could get served ads to\noffset the cost of forwarding. Alternatively, the team is also looking at\nintegrating the Gas Station Network\n[https://medium.com/groundhog-network/the-gas-station-network-alliance-6fd543e7eca3]\n, a collaboration between Ethereum organisations that cover the cost of gas for\nonboarding new users and subsidised apps.\n\nIn the future, the project will have to consider the implications of state rent\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/arw0au/what_is_state_rent_in_ethereum_and_how_does_it/]\n. Users, or the Gas Station Network might have to provide an additional payment\nto wake a dormant contract back into state. A partial workaround for this could\nbe to cache the high traffic URLs in something like Heroku. \n\nFuture UI improvements might include adding a Wyre [https://www.sendwyre.com/] \nintegration to allow users to use credit cards instead of maintaining a\ncompatible wallet. The team hopes to continue working on it as a side project.\n\nHere's a quick video demo of 0xSU in action:\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here's a set of questions we had the team answer:\n\nWhat is your developer background?\n\nJon: I graduated from a full-stack coding bootcamp about a month ago. Before\nthat I just dabbled a little with JavaScript.\n\nAuston: I am a self-taught developer who started writing code about 12 years\nago. I am always interested in learning new languages & Solidity / Ethereum are\nsuper powerful conceptually. \n\nWhat got you into Ethereum / IPFS / decentralisation initially? \n\nJon: I found the idea of the blockchain and its serverless application\nfascinating. I wanted to learn more and my research told me the Ethereum network\nis the best run place to start.\n\nAuston: For me it started in 2011 when my friend Michael had a little hacker\nmeetup & decided to talk about bitcoin. I dismissed it initially but eventually\ncame around to the idea. Finally my friend Kai reached out in 2017 & told me\nabout Ethereum, that’s when I really started to dive deep, as I realized there\nwas now a censorship resistant platform that could be built upon.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nJon: hackernoon, medium, techcrunch, dev.to [http://dev.to/]\n\nAuston: I love hacker news! Twitter is always fun to discover random things & on\noccasion, Hacker Noon. \n\nDo you listen to any technology or developer podcasts?\n\nJon: I would if I found the time.\n\nAuston: Shill time! I have been working on a podcast for a few weeks with my\nfriend Jose, you can go listen to it on the Devshirts' site\n[https://devshirts.co/blogs/podcasts].\n\nIn general, talk about your hackathon experience? Highs / lows?\n\nJon: Was pretty interesting and inspiring. It was my first time and I didn’t\nknow where to begin, but luckily I teamed up with Auston who is a nice guy &\nhelped guide me.\n\nAuston: It was really invigorating to see so many people hyped up about Ethereum\n& working on Dapps. I definitely appreciated the sponsor dev support, we\nlaunched a node on quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  and got some help from\nthen sendwyre.com [http://sendwyre.com/]  team. Also was super cool to get some\nhelp from Vitalik himself debugging an issue with our smart contract. \n\nWhat inspired the project? \n\nGoo.gl [http://goo.gl/]  had been taken down which is a shame because it was a\nuseful service, and we wanted to make sure that couldn’t happen again by using\nthe blockchain.\n\nWhat made you want to integrate IPFS? \n\nAuston: IPFS is a project I’ve known about since 2017 that again I thought would\nbe a super awesome way to distribute copies of content on.\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\nAuston: None really, it was actually super easy for the most part. However I had\nto find a guide that showed me to how to point a domain at the IPFS node.\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you received from judges or other hackathon\nparticipants?\n\nThere were other apps and apis that could make what we did cheaper and faster,\nbut we kept it simple. Also the positive attitude of the judges was really nice\nto have, they were really onboard with the fact that we deployed to main net,\netc. \n\nAny plans to keep working on the project? \n\nWould definitely love to integrate Stripe to make it possible to pay for link\nshortening with a credit/debit card, get more people running a forwarding server\n& perhaps integrate the gas station network to let people pay with BAT or by\nwatching ads.\n\nIn hindsight what’s something you may have done differently for either the\nproject or the hackathon?\n\nAuston: Jon would have liked to integrate more sponsors, but I’m actually really\nhappy with the outcome. \n\nAny side projects or interests you would like to shill?\n\nAuston: Definitely quiknode.io [http://quiknode.io/]  as well as 0xsu.co\n[http://0xsu.co/]  - you should try both and run a forwarding server!!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks Jon & Auston for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn\nfrom. We'll be posting other IPFS projects on this blog as well >> be sure to\ncheck back soon.\n\nOur first product is an IPFS add-on for Heroku. Interested in testing it out\nwhen we launch?
