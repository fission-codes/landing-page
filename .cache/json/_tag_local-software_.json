First we'll look at how the project works,\nfollowed by a few questions FISSION asking about Steven's background.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse\n\nTry it out yourself: https://diffuse.sh [https://diffuse.sh/]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow does Diffuse work\n\nThe basic idea is that users should be able to access music files they own from\nanywhere, even local content.  This ranges from cloud servers like Dropbox or\nGoogle Drive to distributed storage solutions like IPFS. Steven has been\niterating on Diffuse, written in Elm [https://elm-lang.org/], for over 6 years\nnow. The Diffuse About [https://diffuse.sh/about/]  page also has some good\ninformation.\n\nThere are three main pieces to the product: the user data storage,  the file  \nstorage medium, and  the frontend  which sits between them both. \n\nTo start a user would navigate to diffuse.sh [https://diffuse.sh], no need to\ninstall anything. In the current V1, users can authenticate themselves through \nBlockstack [https://blockstack.org/], Remote Storage [https://remotestorage.io/] \n or use the product anonymously via the browser.\n\nhere's what the user sees firstUsing a proper authentication method allows users\nto save things like music metadata, user favourites, and settings, whereas an\n\"anonymous\" login may result in data loss if the browser is cleared. Once they\nhave been authenticated, users are able to add new content or access previously\nadded content. \n\nThe user facing front-end is hosted on Netlify [https://www.netlify.com/].\nFurther down the decentralisation spectrum, it's certainly possible to self-host\nthe frontend by downloading the html and mimicking Netlify (check this IPFS +\nENS site hosting tutorial\n[https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUJKsA1FQRo4rGKJ9WAXNnv6o6HXy4NoJiWH97gPZUddV/ens+ipfs/ENSIPFS-Part-1-Introduction.html]\n). \n\nHere's an example of what would happen under the hood for a file hosted on\nGoogle Drive. Once a user authenticates on Diffuse and requests to add a file,\nthey will be logged into their Google account and asked to allow permissions to\nthe Diffuse app. Once granted, the app will request that Drive construct a\nfiletree, which is a list containing the path to every audio file. It works in\nchunks of 1000 files requested from each url and then gets the music\ntags/metadata from each file via the JSmediatags library\n[https://github.com/aadsm/jsmediatags]. The parsed metadata from those files is\nthen cached in a user's storage provider: in V1 this is limited to either\nBlockstack or RemoteStorage. That way, when a user logs in and any metadata from\npreviously loaded music is already there.\n\nOnce music on the storage medium has been identified and the metadata cached,\nthe app users can enjoy whatever music files they have saved. Content searching\nis facilitated by the Lunr library [https://github.com/olivernn/lunr.js/].\n\nA V2 is already in the works to make the entire product more user friendly. This\nnext version will have data encryption, and even more storage options, including\n Textile [https://textile.io/]  for user data, or Blockstack's Gaia\n[https://docs.blockstack.org/storage/overview.html]  for file access. Fission is\nlooking forward to when the V2 is live hopefully later this summer. We'll plan\nto do a blog post then detailing any of the updates.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, here's a set of questions we asked Steven.\n\nWhat’s your background as a developer?\n\nStarted with web dev as a hobby when I was 15 (I’m 29 now). First gig was for a\nweb agency, mainly doing small artsy websites and a cms using ruby. Four years\nlater I started working for another agency, but mainly doing app development.\nI've been doing all kinds of dev things in my spare time, but my main side\nproject for the last 8 years has been Diffuse and its predecessors.\n\nWhere do you go to read tech news / developer news?\n\nTwitter, email newsletters, slack/discord channels\n\nWhat first inspired Diffuse?\n\nSomeone asked me to build a UI for https://github.com/trevorturk/kzak, and at\nthe same time I was collecting music. Seemed like an interesting idea and fun to\nwork on. Also, I used Spotify for a while, but they kept silently removing some\nof my favourite music, after that I never turned back.\n\nHow has user testing gone?\n\nCould be better. People like the design, made a few feature requests, but never\nreally expressed what could be better. That said, Blockstack recently put\nDiffuse on https://www.trymyui.com/  which has given me good feedback.\n\nWhere have you gotten the bulk of your users?\n\nIPFS forum, https://electronjs.org/apps/diffuse  and chinese/japanese blogs\nabout IPFS. I think… I don’t have any analytics except on Github, so I don’t\nreally know.\n\nWhat was the most useful feedback you’ve received?\n\n“I don’t know how to use this”\n\nWhat is the benefit of using Blockstack? Drawbacks?\n\nEasy decentralized authentication. Drawback, way too much javascript, bad\nperformance.\n\nIf you were to redesign or reset your structure what would you have done\ndifferently?\n\nI’m currently working on V2, which is built from scratch. So this’ll be easy to\nanswer 😄 I like the design very much so that stayed the same, just more fine\ntuned, more attention to detail. Structure has improved as well, better\nperformance, moved more things on the web-worker side, easier to extend (build\non).\n\nWhat challenges did you experience integrating IPFS?\n\n  I don’t really remember the music-storage integration, was over a year ago.\nBut I think it went pretty smoothly, except for a CORS issue which was later\nresolved in go-ipfs. I recently did IPFS “authentication”, or in other words\nuser-data storage, which is the unpublished work-in-progress V2. That was more\nchallenging, I had to find a good way to encrypt the user’s data.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks Steven for spending time to help get this ready for others to learn from.\nWe'll be posting other IPFS projects on this blog as well >> be sure to check\nback soon.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCover image [https://unsplash.com/photos/9f1gCaLkZBU]  from David Jorre\n[https://unsplash.com/@davidjorre]","html":"<p>This is the second post in a series that highlights projects developing solutions that challenge the current norms of user dependency on the cloud.
