I also set\nMedia Quality to \"High\" (although some people still report that these are still\nnot as large as the originals, which may only be accessible through the API).\n\nYou can experiment with including other items. But, be aware that because there\naren't any permissions, you may be sharing information you don't want to if you\npublish the files. Same goes for the photos. I have posted most things on\nFacebook the assumption that they are \"public\".\n\nClick the Create File  button and go make a coffee. Facebook will notify when\nyour download is ready.\n\nJust over 13 years of Facebook.To download, you'll need to click on the Download  button and enter your\nFacebook password. You now have a zip file with browse-able HTML files and your\nphoto and video files.\n\nPutting your files online with Fission\nYou'll need to type a few commands into the command line Terminal on your\nmachine, but everything should just work if you copy-paste.\n\nInstall the IPFS Desktop [https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop#install] \n and run it. You've got a graphical interface to explore your local IPFS server,\nwhich is running in the background.\n\nOn Mac, make sure you've got homebrew installed [https://brew.sh], then open the\nTerminal app and install the Fission tools using these commands:\n\nbrew tap fission-suite/fission\nbrew install fission-cli\n\nYou can find extended installation instructions in our Fission Guide\n[https://guide.fission.codes/installation], and I expect our friends running\nLinux will have no problem.\n\nNow, you're going to register for Fission.\n\nfission register\n\nYour username will be your subdomain, e.g. boris.fission.name. Pick a password\nand enter an email address. We are adding support for custom domain names, stay\ntuned!\n\nNow, you've got a zip file in your Downloads folder from Facebook, called\nsomething like \"facebook-YOURNAME.zip\". Unzip it and you'll have a\n\"facebook-YOURNAME\" folder.\n\nBack to the terminal! This is the last step!\n\nThe fission up  command is going to add all your files to IPFS, through your\nlocal IPFS Desktop. Then, Fission's server will get sent the hash that\nrepresents the folder, we'll use IPFS to keep a copy of all your files, and\nupdate DNS of your subdomain.\n\nThe following command will be correct if you're on a Mac and downloaded to the\nstandard downloads folder. Otherwise, just enter the path to where the unzipped\nFacebook folder is:\n\nfission up ~/Downloads/facebook-YOURNAME/\n\nI only had about 200MB of files, so this happened pretty quickly. Visit\nYOURNAME.fission.name in your browser and you should see something like this:\n\nYour Facebook photos are online and browse-able! You can see mine at \nboris.fission.name/Photos/facebook [https://boris.fission.name/Photos/facebook/] \n (I put mine in a subfolder, because I already host a bunch of public files on\nmy Fission site).\n\nTechnically the files are being served directly from your computer, when you're\nonline and have IPFS Desktop running. The Fission service is also serving those\nfiles, and stays online when you're offline. As a next step, you can explore\ninstalling the IPFS Companion browser extension\n[https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion]  which will access IPFS\ncontent natively.\n\nJoin us in our Discord chat forum [https://fission.codes/discord]  if you have\nquestions or just come say \"hi\"!","html":"<p>Facebook has a fairly extensive data export system built in.

This was the first time our team had all met in person, and we had just a\ncouple of days to wrap up code and documentation for Fission Live.

Stay tuned for further Poutine in Berlin\nadventures.\n\n*But, it did mean that Boris came back with the most excellent prize: 4L of\nmaple syrup! \n\nGetting started with Fission Live Workshop\nOn Saturday, Ben and Brooke walked the audience through getting started with\nFission Live.\n\nBen had worked all night to even have the slides for the presentation\n[https://slides.runfission.com]  hosted on Fission. Daniel was all up in our DNS\ntweaking so that subdomains would \"just work\", and Brooke's fingers were\nspitting out Haskell types in all directions.\n\nDiffusion had three presentation areas right next to each other. Thanks to\nwireless headsets for the presenter audio, it meant the audience could be calm\nand focused while watching the presentation. We really enjoyed this experience,\ndefinitely recommended.\n\nIPFS Help Desk\nHugo and Daniel talking IPNS over DNS and other IPFS protocol intricacies.\nDaniel had just finished hacking together our DNS automation the night before,\nso looking forward to see if we can improve this in the base protocol.It was\ngreat to be able to spend time with Hugo [https://twitter.com/hugomrdias]  and \nVasco [https://twitter.com/vascosantos10]  from Moxy Studio\n[https://moxy.studio/]  who hacked on IPFS and libp2p while hanging out on the\n2nd floor help desk space where we set up camp.\n\nWe shared what we were working on with Fission, and learned a ton about where\nIPFS is heading at the protocol layer, while sharing what we needed to make our\nservices work better. Need someone to run an IPFS help desk at your next hack\nevent? Get in touch! \n\nShipping Live\nWe got a ton done by using Diffusion as a target date to get Fission Live up and\nrunning for the hackathon participants to use.\n\nHere's a quick gif of registering, and then going live, all with our fission\ncommand line tool:\n\nIt was great to see Fission Live get picked up and used by teams throughout\nDiffusion. We learned lots – like how Infura is used as an anonymous gateway\nbecause of how hard it is to store API keys in various automated scenarios, or\nthat if we want our gateway to support hosting SPAs, we'll need to include an\nSPA mode to redirect queries to route.\n\nSee our one page Diffusion on-boarding for Fission Live\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/diffusion-onboarding-for-fission-live-get-your-apps-live-from-your-laptop/295] \n to get started with our Fission CLI tool.

When I'm\nnot working on building tools for the decentralized web, you can catch me\nreading cool books (currently reading\n[https://www.amazon.com/Ubik-Philip-K-Dick-ebook/dp/B005LVR6ZA]), listening to\nmusic (currently listening\n[https://open.spotify.com/album/5jgnoe0auRKrLvvj4qO5VX?si=aA_8ILIYQVKwdVaRjvAexg]\n), or rock climbing (my weekend plans\n[https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105903004/horseshoe-canyon-ranch]). \n\nHere at Fission, we've been hard at working cooking up cool new experiments with\nIPFS. IPFS's content-based addressing which gives us a flat, universal namespace\nto store files and other data prompts us to think differently about how we build\nand deploy software. This leads us to build prototypes and experiments, which\nhelp us:\n\n• Ideate projects that either we or another team can expand upon\n• Test and calibrate the tools we build for real world hands-on usage\n• Prompt the creation of new libraries/technologies\n\nOur most recent application came from a simple question that we asked: if my\npreferences are generally the same across apps, why do I need to fill out that\nsame information in every app?\n\nIntroducing IPFS Portable User Settings\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/ipfs-user-settings/]  — a completely client\nside application that allows you to update your preferences over IPFS and take\nthem with you wherever you go.\n\nPlay around with the live demo\n[https://fission-suite.github.io/ipfs-user-settings/]\nBackground\nWhile the emerging decentralized web and the web of yesteryear differ in many\nways, one way to think about it is as a difference in user model. The web2.0\nuser data model is company (or platform)-centric. This involves locking your\ndata in monolithic company-owned databases, with the end result being that your\nidentity is fragmented and duplicated across a variety of corporate silos. Web3\nbrings with it a new way of conceptualizing data: a user-centric data model. In\nthis model, a user owns their data and that data can only be read/edited by them\nand trusted people and apps. Apps take on a different function: they exist as\n\"windows\" that a user grants permissions to view or make edits to certain\nattributes of their data.\n\nOften, the benefits of web3 technology are put in reactionary terms. That is,\nit's reacting to the overreaches/missteps of the current corporate stewards of\nthe internet: censorship, sloppy or malicious use of user data, temporality\n(will I be able to see my photos on Facebook in 25 years? my archived emails on\nGmail?), and so on. \n\nOne thing that we aim to do at Fission is not only address the failings of web2,\nbut also create positive reasons to make the jump to web3.\n\nDecentralized apps should be fun and easy for developers to create, and exciting\nfor users to adopt because they offer features not possible in the old web. This\nwas our motivation when developing our Portable User Settings. We wanted to give\nthe intuition behind some of what's possible with web3 and a technical demo that\na more robust version could be based on.\n\nWe also wanted to make this app completely p2p. No HTTP gateways required here!\nIf your browser is IPFS-enabled and you're running a local daemon, the app\nconnects to that daemon. If not, it gracefully sets up an in-browser instance of\n js-ipfs [https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs].\n\nThere are lots of directions this could go. Maybe we want to enable universal\ndark mode so that all the websites you browse respect your global dark mode\nsetting? Leave a comment on what portable user setting you'd like to see in the\nworld.\n\nTechnical Results\nThis project yielded not only a pretty neat demo, but also some useful technical\noffshoots:\n\nget-ipfs [https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs]\nOne of the biggest issues that developers can face when trying to make use of\nthe decentralized web is the high barrier to entry. We wrapped our IPFS fallback\nfunctionality into it's own package: get-ipfs\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/get-ipfs]. This is your new one-stop shop for\nloading an IPFS instance into a webpage. It's as simple as const ipfs = await\ngetIpfs()  and you can make direct P2P use of the decentralized web in your\nwebapp. Give it a go and let us know how it works for you!\n\nFission JavaScript Client\nThis app was also our first time using the Fission JavaScript client\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client]  in the wild. While\nadding/getting is done P2P, requests to pin must be sent over HTTP. The library,\nhowever, has all the functionality you need to make IPFS-enabled apps over HTTP.\nCheck out the library [https://github.com/fission-suite/typescript-client]  and\nsee what cool uses you can come up with!\n\nHosted IPFS Node\nWhile we were already hosting an IPFS node, our hosted node is now much more\nrobust. It's capable of handling secure websocket connects (so it can talk to\nin-browser js-ipfs  nodes!) and stores data in S3. Check out the walkthrough we\nposted for setting up your own IPFS node on AWS\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/a-loosely-written-guide-to-hosting-an-ipfs-node-on-aws/234]\n!\n\nAgain, checkout the demo here\n[https://fission-suite.github.io/ipfs-user-settings/], or keep reading to find\nout how to build and host your own!\n\nRun/Deploy your own app\nFork the repo\nNote: This is only necessary if you are planning on deploying your own user\nsettings app. If you just want to play around locally, you can simply clone the\nrepository.\n\nClick \"Fork\" in the upper-right corner of the repository.\n\nClone the repo locally\nIn your terminal, clone the ipfs-user-settings  repo:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\ncd ipfs-user-settings\n\nSetup environment\nThe environment variables are optional, but will need to be setup for the best\nuser experience.\n\nFirst, create a .env  file in the root of the repository:\ntouch .env\n\nYour .env  will end up looking something like this:\n\nREACT_APP_DEFAULT_CID = QmUWWqCNSdZmus7mc52um5cpqUi1CaE97AzBTY7iWfBXV9\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE = /dns4/ipfs.runfission.com/tcp/4003/wss/ipfs/QmVLEz2SxoNiFnuyLpbXsH6SvjPTrHNMU88vCQZyhgBzgw\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_URL = https://runfission.com\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_USERNAME = ADD_USERNAME_HERE\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_PASSWORD = ADD_PASSWORD_HERE\n\n\nLet's walk through what each of those variables will do.\n\nREACT_APP_DEFAULT_CID: the cid that contains the default settings that you want\na new user to see. You can set it to the above value for our recommended\ndefaults (or leave it blank and it will default to that).\n\n**Edited this section to reflect recent changes**\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_TCP: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like\nthe user's node to connect to through tcp (for instance with a local daemon\nthrough ipfs companion [https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion]). You\ncan set it to the above value to connect to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or\nleave it blank and it will default to that).\nREACT_APP_BOOTSTRAP_NODE_WSS: the multiaddr of the ipfs node that you would like\nthe user's node to connect to through wss (if the user does not have an\nipfs-enabled browser and falls back to an in-browser js-ipfs daemon). You can\nset it to the above value to connect  to the IPFS node that Fission hosts (or\nleave it blank and it will  default to that). \nNote:  if you use a custom node, it must be interoperable with js-ipfs. This\nmeans that it either needs to connect via WebRTC or Secured Websockets (notice\nthe wss  in the above multiaddr).\n\nREACT_APP_INTERPLANETARY_FISSION_...: the last three variables are your\nprovisioned account information for using the Fission web-api. These are used\nfor pinning content to the Fission IPFS node so that content will stay online\neven after a user goes offline. If you leave them blank, the webapp will not pin\nuser content. At the moment, these can be obtained by joining the Fission\nHeroku\nadd-on alpha [https://elements.heroku.com/addons/interplanetary-fission]. If\nyou've tried out our earlier photo gallery demo\n[https://github.com/fission-suite/ipfs-photo-gallery], you can use the same\ncredentials here, otherwise follow that tutorial\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/ipfs-photo-gallery-in-alpha-mode/197/10]  to\nprovision a username and password\n\nRun the app locally\nFirst install dependencies:\nnpm install\n\nThen run the app:\nnpm run start\n\nThis will open up a page in your browser at http://localhost:3000!\n\nPlay around a bit! Try changing your settings, saving it, and loading past CIDs.\n\nBuild app\nIn order for your app to build with the correct internal links, you'll need to\nchange the homepage:\nOpen package.json  and change the homepage  to the url where this site will be\nhosted ($YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ipfs-user-settings).\n\nBuild the app:\nnpm run build\n\n\nDeploy app\nDeploy with your favorite tool: Heroku, GitHub pages, etc. Or if you're reading\nthis a month from now, use the new \"Fission Live\" tool 😉\n\nWe've included a deployment command for GitHub pages.\n\nFirst, make sure that your repository is set as the git remote.\nThis won't work if it's still set to fission-suite.\n\nRun: git remote -v  and ensure that that the url next to remote is \nhttps://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\n\nIf you forked the repo earlier, this should be fine. If you do need to change\nyour remote, just run\ngit remote set origin https://github.com/$YOUR_USERNAME/ipfs-user-settings.git\n\nDeploy the app:\nnpm run deploy\n\nNow open your browser to $YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/ipfs-user-settings  to see\nyour site up and running!\n\nLet us know how it goes! We're always eager to hear any feedback so come join\nthe conversation on our forum [https://talk.fission.codes/], Discord\n[https://discord.gg/daDMAjE], or GitHub [https://github.com/fission-suite/].","html":"<p><em>My name is Daniel, and I'm the newest member of the Fission team.
