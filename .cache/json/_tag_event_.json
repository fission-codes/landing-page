Drupal is\n19 years old this year!I went on to host Dries in Vancouver [https://dri.es/album/vancouver-2004/]  in\n2004, along with the first printed Drupal t-shirts, a beer tower\n[https://dri.es/album/vancouver-2004/pub-beer-tower-2], and the folks from\nDeanSpace / CivicSpace (working on the Democratic primaries) flew up to join us.\n\nAllow me some brief nostalgia…\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI founded Bryght\n[https://www.drupal.org/forum/general/news-and-announcements/2004-08-30/who-are-these-bryght-guys]\n, one of the first commercial companies focused on Drupal, helped organize many\nmore DrupalCons and DrupalCamps, and helped found the Drupal Association.\n\nFOSDEM 2005, before which the first DrupalCon had about 40 peopleWe were in the\nthick of Web 1.0 transitioning to Web 2.0, and the early days of identity\nstandards and communication between websites. That post I made about the \nrecipe.module  is actually tied to a Blogger.com account, which at the time you\ncould use to login to drupal.org.\n\nOpen source licenses and the details of GPL were hotly contested, and we faced a\nlot of FUD from Microsoft and others. A global community using mailing lists and\nIRC was forming, and we didn't know what we were doing was new and different,\nbut that we had come for the code and were staying for the community.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, I see Web3 emerging – although the blog post where I attempt to define what\nthat means to me still isn't finished yet!\n\nNew open source licenses are emerging (Dries on Makers and Takers\n[https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source]),\nbusiness models beyond the advertising supported web are being sought for.\n\nAdvances in computer science theory have given us new tools for distributed\nsystems and cryptography, leading to both better privacy and programmable\nInternet money. \n\nDries' post on low-code and no code tools\n[https://dri.es/low-code-and-no-code-tools-continue-to-drive-the-web-forward] \nshows more changes that I think fit into this theme:\n\n> When everyone is a builder, more good things will happen on the web. I was\nexcited about this trend more than 12 years ago, and remain excited today. I'm\neager to see the progress no-code and low-code solutions will bring to the web\nin the next decade.\nThe Drupal community has long been eager to experiment with new technology and\nstandards.

This was the first time our team had all met in person, and we had just a\ncouple of days to wrap up code and documentation for Fission Live. Here's our\nrecap of the experience, from shipping to funding, and all stops in between.\n\nMaking friends with Poutine\nWe started things off on Friday night with our second meetup (we held the first\none as part of Berlin Blockchain Week) at Poutine Kitchen\n[http://thepoutinekitchen.de/]. \n\n> I can’t believe the #SoggyFries\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoggyFries?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]  shade.\nLook at the beauty of a “Berlin” style Poutine: a Curry Wurst on top \npic.twitter.com/nzU6ZFIEKq [https://t.co/nzU6ZFIEKq]\n\n— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) October 18, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1185235897803067396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nAnd then the majority of the team headed back* to keep coding and documenting so\nthings would be all set and as easy as possible for our hackathon users (yay\nshipping!).\n\nThanks everyone for joining us, and for experiencing the \"Canadian Kiss\" and\nother secret Canadian rituals. Stay tuned for further Poutine in Berlin\nadventures.\n\n*But, it did mean that Boris came back with the most excellent prize: 4L of\nmaple syrup! \n\nGetting started with Fission Live Workshop\nOn Saturday, Ben and Brooke walked the audience through getting started with\nFission Live.\n\nBen had worked all night to even have the slides for the presentation\n[https://slides.runfission.com]  hosted on Fission. Daniel was all up in our DNS\ntweaking so that subdomains would \"just work\", and Brooke's fingers were\nspitting out Haskell types in all directions.\n\nDiffusion had three presentation areas right next to each other. Thanks to\nwireless headsets for the presenter audio, it meant the audience could be calm\nand focused while watching the presentation. We really enjoyed this experience,\ndefinitely recommended.\n\nIPFS Help Desk\nHugo and Daniel talking IPNS over DNS and other IPFS protocol intricacies.\nDaniel had just finished hacking together our DNS automation the night before,\nso looking forward to see if we can improve this in the base protocol.It was\ngreat to be able to spend time with Hugo [https://twitter.com/hugomrdias]  and \nVasco [https://twitter.com/vascosantos10]  from Moxy Studio\n[https://moxy.studio/]  who hacked on IPFS and libp2p while hanging out on the\n2nd floor help desk space where we set up camp.\n\nWe shared what we were working on with Fission, and learned a ton about where\nIPFS is heading at the protocol layer, while sharing what we needed to make our\nservices work better. Need someone to run an IPFS help desk at your next hack\nevent? Get in touch! \n\nShipping Live\nWe got a ton done by using Diffusion as a target date to get Fission Live up and\nrunning for the hackathon participants to use.\n\nHere's a quick gif of registering, and then going live, all with our fission\ncommand line tool:\n\nIt was great to see Fission Live get picked up and used by teams throughout\nDiffusion. We learned lots – like how Infura is used as an anonymous gateway\nbecause of how hard it is to store API keys in various automated scenarios, or\nthat if we want our gateway to support hosting SPAs, we'll need to include an\nSPA mode to redirect queries to route.\n\nSee our one page Diffusion on-boarding for Fission Live\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/diffusion-onboarding-for-fission-live-get-your-apps-live-from-your-laptop/295] \n to get started with our Fission CLI tool.

He's been talking about the history and\nevolution of open source, with a special focus on the legal innovation around\nlicensing. Check out the video & link to slides in our other post\n[https://blog.fission.codes/open-source-licensing-evolution-at-diffusion-2019/]\n\nMaple Syrup is for Winners\nThe top winner of the Diffusion hackathon was Decentralify (see Devpost entry\n[https://devpost.com/software/decentralify]) , built by Marco\n[https://twitter.com/mediaquery]  and Eugene [https://twitter.com/toxzique].\nThey used the Netlify Docker image, ran it on iExec, and then deployed the build\noutput to Fission.\n\nBuilding an \"open\" Netlify is part of the vision we have for Fission, so seeing\nit get built as a hackathon project, a day after we shipped the functionality,\nwas amazing.\n\nAnd here's how Marco feels about his Fission prize:\n\n> Actually, forget about the other prizes.

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an incredibly powerful new protocol that gives every piece of data its own unique address. It’s also more immutable than the way many smart contracts work.</p><p>Boris recently wrote about the <a href=\"https://blog.bmannconsulting.com/ethereum-governance/\">layers of Ethereum Governance</a>, and has a long history of involvement with open source. He will talk about participating in the Ethereum Community, the ETH1x roadmap, and how anyone can learn to contribute to open source communities.</p><p>The theme is Cypherpunk Speakeasy, and there will be xDAI and Burner Wallets. Kurt Barry, a software engineer from MakerDAO, will be giving a primer on DAI, the crypto we will be using for payments.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><style type=\"text/css\">\n#meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix:after { visibility: hidden; display: block; font-size: 0; content: \" \"; clear: both; height: 0; }\n* html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix, *:first-child+html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix { zoom: 1; }\n#meetup_oembed { background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:10px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;margin:0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; }\n#meetup_oembed h3 { font-weight:normal; margin:0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:26px; font-family:Georgia,Palatino,serif; font-size:24px }\n#meetup_oembed p { margin: 0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:16px; }\n#meetup_oembed img { border:none; margin:0; padding:0; }\n#meetup_oembed a, #meetup_oembed a:visited, #meetup_oembed a:link { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: none; cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; }\n#meetup_oembed a:hover { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: underline; }\n#meetup_oembed a.mu_button { font-size:14px; -moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;border:2px solid #A7241D;color:white!important;text-decoration:none;background-color: #CA3E47; background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ca3e47, #a8252e); background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top, color-stop(0, #a8252e), color-stop(1, #ca3e47));disvplay:inline-block;padding:5px 10px; }\n#meetup_oembed a.mu_button:hover { color: #fff!important; text-decoration: none; }\n#meetup_oembed .photo { width:50px; height:50px; overflow:hidden;background:#ccc;float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;text-align:center;padding:1px; }\n#meetup_oembed .photo img { height:50px }\n#meetup_oembed .number { font-size:18px; }\n#meetup_oembed .thing { text-transform: uppercase; color: #555; }\n</style>\n<div id=\"meetup_oembed\" style=\"height:418px\">\n     <div style=\"max-height:378px;overflow:hidden\">\n          <h3>Seattle Ethereum's First Cypherpunk Speakeasy!</h3>\n          <p style=\"margin:5px 0;font-size:16px\">Tuesday, May 28, 2019,  6:30 PM</p>\n          <p style=\"margin: 0 0 5px;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Ada's Lab</span><br>\n<span style=\"font-size:12px;\">425 15th Avenue E Seattle, wa</span></p>\n\n          <span style=\"color:#4F8A10;font-size:16px;\">42 Ethers Attending</span> \n          <div style=\"margin:5px 0 10px\" class=\"mu_clearfix\">\n               <div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/c/7/2/b/thumb_271250987.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/a/d/3/thumb_276767827.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/2/8/f/a/thumb_275950490.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/4/3/9/8/thumb_282257304.jpeg\"></div><div class=\"photo\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/e/1/3/8/thumb_285537656.jpeg\"></div>\n          </div>\n          <p style=\"line-height:16px\">Get ready - it's Seattle's first Cypherpunk Speakeasy!
