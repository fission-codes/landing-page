This was the first time our team had all met in person, and we had just a\ncouple of days to wrap up code and documentation for Fission Live. Here's our\nrecap of the experience, from shipping to funding, and all stops in between.\n\nMaking friends with Poutine\nWe started things off on Friday night with our second meetup (we held the first\none as part of Berlin Blockchain Week) at Poutine Kitchen\n[http://thepoutinekitchen.de/]. \n\n> I can‚Äôt believe the #SoggyFries\n[https://twitter.com/hashtag/SoggyFries?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]  shade.\nLook at the beauty of a ‚ÄúBerlin‚Äù style Poutine: a Curry Wurst on top \npic.twitter.com/nzU6ZFIEKq [https://t.co/nzU6ZFIEKq]\n\n‚Äî FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) October 18, 2019\n[https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1185235897803067396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw]\nAnd then the majority of the team headed back* to keep coding and documenting so\nthings would be all set and as easy as possible for our hackathon users (yay\nshipping!).\n\nThanks everyone for joining us, and for experiencing the \"Canadian Kiss\" and\nother secret Canadian rituals. Stay tuned for further Poutine in Berlin\nadventures.\n\n*But, it did mean that Boris came back with the most excellent prize: 4L of\nmaple syrup! \n\nGetting started with Fission Live Workshop\nOn Saturday, Ben and Brooke walked the audience through getting started with\nFission Live.\n\nBen had worked all night to even have the slides for the presentation\n[https://slides.runfission.com]  hosted on Fission. Daniel was all up in our DNS\ntweaking so that subdomains would \"just work\", and Brooke's fingers were\nspitting out Haskell types in all directions.\n\nDiffusion had three presentation areas right next to each other. Thanks to\nwireless headsets for the presenter audio, it meant the audience could be calm\nand focused while watching the presentation. We really enjoyed this experience,\ndefinitely recommended.\n\nIPFS Help Desk\nHugo and Daniel talking IPNS over DNS and other IPFS protocol intricacies.\nDaniel had just finished hacking together our DNS automation the night before,\nso looking forward to see if we can improve this in the base protocol.It was\ngreat to be able to spend time with Hugo [https://twitter.com/hugomrdias]  and \nVasco [https://twitter.com/vascosantos10]  from Moxy Studio\n[https://moxy.studio/]  who hacked on IPFS and libp2p while hanging out on the\n2nd floor help desk space where we set up camp.\n\nWe shared what we were working on with Fission, and learned a ton about where\nIPFS is heading at the protocol layer, while sharing what we needed to make our\nservices work better. Need someone to run an IPFS help desk at your next hack\nevent? Get in touch! \n\nShipping Live\nWe got a ton done by using Diffusion as a target date to get Fission Live up and\nrunning for the hackathon participants to use.\n\nHere's a quick gif of registering, and then going live, all with our fission\ncommand line tool:\n\nIt was great to see Fission Live get picked up and used by teams throughout\nDiffusion. We learned lots ‚Äì like how Infura is used as an anonymous gateway\nbecause of how hard it is to store API keys in various automated scenarios, or\nthat if we want our gateway to support hosting SPAs, we'll need to include an\nSPA mode to redirect queries to route.\n\nSee our one page Diffusion on-boarding for Fission Live\n[https://talk.fission.codes/t/diffusion-onboarding-for-fission-live-get-your-apps-live-from-your-laptop/295] \n to get started with our Fission CLI tool.

He's been talking about the history and\nevolution of open source, with a special focus on the legal innovation around\nlicensing. Check out the video & link to slides in our other post\n[https://blog.fission.codes/open-source-licensing-evolution-at-diffusion-2019/]\n\nMaple Syrup is for Winners\nThe top winner of the Diffusion hackathon was Decentralify (see Devpost entry\n[https://devpost.com/software/decentralify]) , built by Marco\n[https://twitter.com/mediaquery]  and Eugene [https://twitter.com/toxzique].\nThey used the Netlify Docker image, ran it on iExec, and then deployed the build\noutput to Fission.\n\nBuilding an \"open\" Netlify is part of the vision we have for Fission, so seeing\nit get built as a hackathon project, a day after we shipped the functionality,\nwas amazing.\n\nAnd here's how Marco feels about his Fission prize:\n\n> Actually, forget about the other prizes.

The term ‚Äúremote‚Äù work itself implies tasks being done at arm‚Äôs length, and at some critical remove between object and subject. I‚Äôm here, and ‚Äúthe work‚Äù is over there, in other words.

Python is 28 years old, and\nthe context is ‚Äî how does it stay relevant for the next 10 years? How does it\nplan to do things, to remain relevant? And what ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù events does Python\nneed to be prepared for?\n\nThe essential topic is, Python has been around for 28 years; how does it make\nsure it stays around for 10 more years? Covers ‚Äúblack swan‚Äù events, open source\ncommunity norms, WASM, volunteerism vs. funding experts, contributor burn out,\nand more.\n\nTake Aways for Ethereum\nA lot of this is familiar to be me because I have a long history with open\nsource projects. But, that‚Äôs history: one big point is that we need to be\nthinking about ‚Äî and planning for! ‚Äî the future of collaborative projects. From\nmy recent involvement with the Ethereum project [2], I‚Äôve been thinking a lot\nabout the topics covered.\n\nI feel like Ethereum and its component parts (I‚Äôve started calling this the\n‚ÄúEthereum Stack‚Äù, more on this in a bit) are just on the way towards becoming\nmore traditional open source projects, from its relatively centralized roots.\n\nAlexey‚Äôs article about Eth1x\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60] \n highlights this shift well: a shift in who  works on research and\nimplementation, and a shift in how  the process is changing and needs to\ncontinue to evolve.\n\n> Now, instead of waiting for some developers in well-established implementation\nteams to get interested in a proposal, it is possible to form a working group\nand start working on it. Of course, it is still not trivial, because it requires\nfinding people who want to do the work, people who want to pay for it, etc. But\nat least it hopefully gives us a nice separation of duties, and a more scalable\nprocess.\n\n‚Äî Alexey Akhunov\n[https://medium.com/@akhounov/ethereum-1x-as-an-attempt-to-change-the-process-783efa23cf60]\nIn other open source communities, a foundation or other entities comes after \ngrowth of the community. We‚Äôre in the midst of seeing the Ethereum Foundation\n[https://ethereum.foundation]  actively divest itself of core responsibilities.\n\nOh, and if you don‚Äôt know Python, python2 and python3, which after 10 years\nstill co-exist, are also useful to look at for thoughts on ETH2.\n\nIf I could, I would want to get up on stage at DevCon5 [https://devcon.org]  and\nessentially give the exact same talk, applied to Ethereum.\n\nHere are specific areas of the talk, applied to Ethereum:\n\nBecoming Open Source\nEthereum is still learning what it means to be an open source project; we need\nto spread a culture of getting involved, contributions that go beyond code, and\niteratively making things better.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means turning ‚Äúthis sucks‚Äù into actionable items, that\nget assigned / have ownership taken, and that get reviewed weekly and monthly.\n\nEvery day, we make things suck less. It may not sound like the best rallying\ncry, but trust me when I say that this appeals to engineering and ‚Äúdo-er‚Äù\nmindsets, and that compounding effort pays off. #WeighingWei\n\nI am asking non-code contributors to learn basic open source code repository\nnorms (issues & PRs), asking developers who may not have organic open source\nexperience outside of Ethereum to welcome new contributors (#goodFirstIssue,\nbettering CONTRIBUTING documentation, resources dedicated to bringing on new\ncode contributors), and all of us to learn how to collaborate better.\n\nOpen Source Licensing & Funding isn‚Äôt a Solved Problem\nOpen source licensing and funding is at a cross roads, so along with learning\nfrom other open source projects and norms, Ethereum has an opportunity to lead\nin experiments in these areas.\n\nOpen source licensing in Ethereum has not been a strategic consideration. There\nis a mess of different licensing, and many of the licenses used slow down\nadoption by commercial companies and enterprise. Part of the discussion around\nopen source licensing in the broader world is as an opportunity to generate\nrevenue, and to reinforce contributions to the commons.\n\nFunding innovations are popping up left and right in Ethereum, but I would say\nthat only Gitcoin and Gitcoin Grants are firmly rooted in an open source project\ntradition. Meaning: I think other efforts need to understand how to incorporate\nopen source awareness into their thinking.\n\nEmbrace the Ethereum Stack\nI‚Äôve started to think about Ethereum as the ‚ÄúEthereum Stack‚Äù ‚Äî the EVM, JSON-RPC\nmiddleware, the devp2p networking layer, the Solidity smart contract language,\nthe EIPs that set specifications, the client software that powers nodes ‚Äî all of\nthese are in many cases open source projects of their own, coordinating and\ncollaborating together, and also getting remixed in different chains,\nsidechains, and private enterprise contexts.\n\nThis is a strength if  we can make a tent that is bigger than main-net Ethereum.\nWhile still leaning into Ethereum public main-net as a global umbrella that the\nentire stack can benefit from and link into.\n\nThe Ethereum community‚Äôs ‚Äúspecification first‚Äù approach to building software and\nsupporting multiple client implementations is potentially a core strength here.\n\nWe‚Äôve been gathering EVM-related news (I‚Äôm realizing that EVM is another analog\nfor Ethereum Stack) on the RUN EVM site [https://RUNEVM.com]. And yet, I was\nstill surprised to see ThoughtWorks Radar highlight ‚ÄúEVM beyond Ethereum‚Äù\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/evm-beyond-ethereum#.XMNHO1fOmME.link]\n; it‚Äôs in their ‚ÄúTrial‚Äù category, one before ‚ÄúAdopt‚Äù recommendation.\n\nEVM beyond Ethereum in the \"Trial\" area of ThoughtWorks Radar Platform category\n[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms]Ethereum‚Äôs Black Swans\nWhat disruptions and major shifts in the broader technology industry might\naffect Ethereum? Even while thinking about distributed ledger technology and\nrelated decentralized web tech as a disruption itself, we need to look at how\nthe Ethereum stack fits into other changes.\n\nWASM\nThe community is already working on improving the EVM and making the transition\nto WASM [3], which is mentioned in the video.\n\nSolidity, as a major programming language in the ecosystem, in part ‚Äúcompetes‚Äù\nwith Python. On the other hand, enabling the Python developer community to write\nEthereum compatible smart contracts is a huge win for our community. This is why\nI want to see LLVM to EVM work today [4], which lets us start recruiting other\nlanguage developers today, and sets us up for support in WASM as well (that is,\nit‚Äôs not duplication, it‚Äôs forward compatible work, as WASM relies on LLVM for\nother language compatibility as well).\n\nMobile as a Programming Environment\nPersonally, I have been jumping up and down over mobile support, not just for\nEthereum powered applications, but also for writing / launching apps. I see the\nsame ‚Äúmake Ethereum programming work from your phone‚Äù opportunity and threat\nhighlighted by Russell.\n\nSince Ethereum chains run continuously as a global ‚Äúbackend‚Äù ‚Äî I see this as an\nopportunity! Front end apps written in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML can get written\n& deployed from mobile devices today ‚Äî with Ethereum blockchains providing a\nshared backend. This is connected to the ‚Äúhostless‚Äù theme that we are following\nat FISSION.\n\nWhat should we work on?\nThe entire video has lessons, so I really encourage anyone interested in open\nsource, software communities, and contributor culture to watch the whole thing.\n\nHere are my top two picks on base level strengths that I think the Ethereum\ncommunity can work on:\n\n 1. Become experts at commons based peer production, from non-code\n    collaboration, to funding, to open source licensing. Celebrate experiments\n    and new entrants, while also Getting Shit Done.\n 2. Work on building strong maintainers and communities around all components of\n    the Ethereum Stack, and look for adoption of the stack everywhere.\n\nFISSION‚Äôs mission is to bring decentralized web technologies to the wider\ndevelopment community by solving real problems today & exploring fundamental\nshifts in the way we host, deploy, and run software for humans.
