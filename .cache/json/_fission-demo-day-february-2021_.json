This week we invited Jeremy Rustin of the\nTiddlyWiki project to talk about his product and our plans to integrate\nFissionâ€™s Webnative SDK with TiddlyWiki. \n\nMeet the Team\nOur distributed team continues to grow with team members spanning from our HQ in\nVancouver across three continents. Our newest addition is Courtney in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ North\nCarolina, United States. \n\nCourtney (@Courtney [https://talk.fission.codes/u/courtney]) joins us as our\nMarketing Lead. This was her first week with Fission and her first demo day.\nLook for more blog posts and email updates from Courtney about what's going on\nwith Fission. \n\nFission and Headless Ghost\nFission teammate Helder (@agentofuser [https://talk.fission.codes/u/agentofuser]\n) shared his work with Headless Ghost and Fission. He showed us how to use the\nGhost CMS as a familiar editing interface for content producers and then pulling\nthe content into a Next.JS website via API. Then, the content is compiled into a\nstatic website using React and deployed to the Fission platform. Check out the\nvideo to hear the details of this process. \n\nFilecoin Backup App\nNext, we heard from Ben (@benjaminbollen\n[https://talk.fission.codes/u/benjaminbollen]) and Brian (@bgins\n[https://talk.fission.codes/u/bgins]) about their work with Filecoin. Filecoin\nis a blockchain specifically used for storing files online without relying on a\nthird-party platform or company. Because Fission is also interested in working\nin browsers very securely, we decided to work with the Filecoin team on this\nproject. Hear from Ben and Brian about their progress in the Fission Demo Day\nvideo. \n\nIPFS Cluster Updates\nDaniel (@dholms [https://talk.fission.codes/u/dholms]) talked to us about his\nupdates to the IPFS Cluster. Fission is built on an Interplanetary File System\n(or IPFS) which is a global peer-to-peer network. Fission builds encryption on\ntop of the IPFS stack, running IPFS servers to make sure that your data stays\nonline and accessible directly from the browser, all with your security in mind.\nDaniel shares with us some recent backend infrastructure work he's doing to\nimprove our system performance. \n\nTiddlywiki and Fission\nJeremy Rustin (@jermolene [https://twitter.com/Jermolene]) is the creator of\nTiddlywiki, a serverless web app that allows users to create a non-linear\nnotebook for recording, organizing and sharing complex information. We're\ncollaborating to build an app that will allow users to use TiddlyWiki on the\nFission platform. You can hear from Jeremy directly in the Demo Day video. Weâ€™ve\nalso been working out in the open in the TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum\n[https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57]  so hop over there to see\nwhat's going on. \n\nVideo\nJoin us next time\nWe're experimenting with Luma [https://lu.ma/]  for registering for events.\nClick the button below to sign up for the Fission March 2021 Demo Day, or visit\nthe event page [https://lu.ma/fission-march-2021]  Â»\n\nRegister for Event [https://lu.ma/event/evt-pBdosunE2c0q5Rl]","html":"<p>We meet on the third-Thursday-of-the-month for \"Demo Days\" where the Fission team talks about new releases &amp; product updates, early demos of in-progress work, planned roadmap items followed by an open Q&amp;A.
