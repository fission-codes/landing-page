  Fission provides app hosting with user controlled data.
  Weâ€™re building a web native file system that combines files, encryption, and identity, like an open source iCloud.

    Fission for Developers

  about:
    Get started with Fission to bring your apps live directly from your laptop. Publish static files, websites, and JavaScript front ends and keep them updated in real time. We use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to power peer-to-peer files.

    Drive for Users

  about:
    Every user creating a Fission Account gets access to Drive. Your files, available everywhere, even offline. Private files are encrypted end-to-end. Easily publish and share public files. Add an app, give permission to what files it can access, just like you're used to on mobile.
