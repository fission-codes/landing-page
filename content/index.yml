tagline:
  Build and Scale Apps

short_description:
  As a developer, if you can build an app for a single user, Fission will let you share it with 10 or 10,000 users, without any changes.

    No more yak shaving

  about:
    You've built an app, it looks great on your machine. Now you have to figure out where to host it, how to scale it, and how to make it easy for other people to try it as well. You've got nothing but days of yak shaving ahead of you!<br />
    <br />
    Build apps that include passwordless login, end-to-end encryption, and offline support, without having to learn complicated DevOps techniques.<br />
    <br />
    Let your app users own their data, with more scale and less cost to you. Weâ€™ve built a web native file system that combines files, encryption, and identity, like an open source iCloud.

    Add an app, give permission to what files it can access, just like you're used to on mobile.
