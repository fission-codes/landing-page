tagline:
  Build and Scale Apps


short_description:
  Fission helps front end developers to quickly and easily publish files, websites, and apps directly from your local machine. If you can build an app for a single user, you can share it with 10 or 10,000 users, without any changes.
  <br /><br />
  Use the frameworks you already know to create front end features, and power your app with Fission's backend-as-a-service capabilities including passwordless login, end-to-end encryption, and offline support â€” without having to learn complicated DevOps techniques!

    Fission Drive is a file storage and identity system that lets you take your files anywhere, and access them from any web or mobile browser.
    <br /><br />
    Every Fission Drive account features a passwordless login that works in all web browsers, and has file storage included.
    <br /><br />
    Our webnative file system offers offline support as well - you can even access your files without an Internet connection.
    <br /><br />
    You control your data! You can easily access, publish and share public files, websites, and apps. Private files are encrypted end-to-end.
    <br />
    Add an app, give permission to what files it can access - just like on mobile.

fission_for_developers:

  description:
    Fission empowers front-end developers to build and scale apps with no backend or DevOps skills required.
    <br /><br />
    The Fission webnative SDK takes advantage of all the capabilities your browser has to offer, as well as local computation, storage, and identity. Deploy web apps from your laptop that are secure and private by default, just like native mobile apps.
    <br /><br />
    Local-first functionality also supports working without an Internet connection on desktop and mobile whenever possible. Apps scale running client side with offline support and sync.
