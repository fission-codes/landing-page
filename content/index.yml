    Fission Live

  about:
    Get started with Fission to bring your apps live directly from your laptop. Publish static files, websites, and JavaScript front ends and keep them updated in real time. We use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to power peer-to-peer files.

    No more yak shaving

  about:
    You've built an app, it looks great on your machine. Now you have to figure out where to host it, how to scale it, and how to make it easy for other people to try it as well. You've got nothing but days of yak shaving ahead of you!<br />
    <br />
    Build apps that include passwordless login, end-to-end encryption, and offline support, without having to learn complicated DevOps techniques.<br />
    <br />
    Let your app users own their data, with more scale and less cost to you. If you can build an app for a single user, Fission will let you share it with 10 or 10,000 users, without any changes.
