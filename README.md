## Setup

On Mac: `brew install just`, or [see full just install](https://github.com/casey/just)

Uses `elm-git` for install, so you'll need to have your [SSH key setup for Github](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## How to use

```shell
# üç±
just install-deps

# Build, watch & start server
